This book was written based on notes from which the author gave
lectures. Consequently, words may have multiple spelling variations
or inconsistent hyphenation. These have been left unchanged unless
indicated below. Obsolete spelling was retained. Obvious printing
errors, such as backwards, upside down, reversed, dropped, or partially
printed letters and punctuation, were corrected. Repeated words over
line breaks were removed. An ñ was substituted for an n with a macron.

Words and phrases in italics are surrounded by underscores, _like
this_. Those in bold are surrounded by equal signs, =like this=.
Sidenotes are surrounded by diamonds, ♦ like this. ♦ Final stops missing
at the end of sentences and abbreviations were added. Book II, Chapter
3, omits paragraph 10 §. Footnotes were renumbered sequentially. The
table of generic differences of flavors was reformatted to fit narrower
screens. A few page numbers in the index were corrected to match
the related text.

The following were changed:

  added missing word: “of” ... on either side of it, ...
  changed “in” to “its” ... from its _Inner_ or _Central Parts_ ...
  deleted “is” from “as it is seems” ... as it seems, ...
  added missing letters “seve” to “several” ... in the several
     _Parcels_ ...
  added missing word: “of” ... ⅓ of a Foot long ...
  added missing word: “of” ... Inside of the Sheath ...
  added missing word: “do” ... In order to do this ...

The following overall Table of Contents to the book was added by the

                               TO HIS MOST

                             Sacred Majesty

                               CHARLES II.

                       King of Great Britain, &c.


May it please Your Majesty,

_The Dedication of one Part of the following_ Anatomy _having been very
graciously received by Your Majesty: I am now emboldened most humbly to
present the Whole into_ Your Royal Hands.

_By which Your Majesty will find, That there are_ Terræ Incognitæ _in_
Philosophy, _as well as_ Geography. _And for so much, as lies here, it
comes to pass, I know not how, even in this Inquisitive Age, That I am
the first, who have given a Map of the Country._

_Your Majesty will here see, That there are those things within a_
Plant, _little less admirable, than within an_ Animal. _That a_ Plant,
_as well as an_ Animal, _is composed of several_ Organical Parts; _some
whereof may be called its_ Bowels. _That every_ Plant _hath_ Bowels
_of divers kinds, conteining divers kinds of_ Liquors. _That even a_
Plant _lives partly upon_ Aer; _for the reception whereof, it hath
those Parts which are answerable to_ Lungs. _So that a_ Plant _is, as
it were, an_ Animal _in Quires; as an_ Animal _is a_ Plant, _or rather
several_ Plants _bound up into one_ Volume.

_Again, that all the said_ Organs, Bowels, _or other_ Parts, _are as
artificially made; and for their_ Place _and_ Number, _as punctually
set together; as all the_ Mathematick Lines _of a_ Flower _or_ Face.
_That the_ Staple _of the_ Stuff _is so exquisitely fine, that no_
Silk-worm _is able to draw any thing near so small a_ Thred. _So
that one who walks about with the meanest_ Stick, _holds a Piece of
Natures Handicraft, which far surpasses the most elaborate_ Woof _or_
Needle-Work _in the World._

_That by all these Means, the_ Ascent _of the_ Sap, _the_ Distribution
_of the_ Aer, _the_ Confection _of several sorts of_ Liquors, _as_
Lympha’s, Milks, Oyls, Balsames; _with other parts of_ Vegetation, _are
all contrived and brought about in a Mechanical way. In sum, Your
Majesty will find, that we are come ashore into a new World, whereof we
see no end._

_It may be, that some will say, into another_ Utopia. _Yet not I, but
Nature speaketh these things: the only true_ Pallas, _wherewith it is
treasonable for the most couriously handed_ Arachne _to compare. In
whose Name, I, the meanest of her Pupils, do in all humility crave
Your Majesties Gracious Patronage. Whereof I cannot doubt, since Your
Majesty hath been pleased to be the Founder, and to style Your Self the
Patron of that_ Society, _of which I have the honour to be a Member.
Your Majesty deeming it to be a more Noble Design, To enlarge the
Territories of Knowledge, than those of Dominion: and the Highest Pitch
of Human Glory, not to rule, in any sort, over many; but to be a Good
Prince over Wise Men. I am_

                             Your Majesties
                               most humble
                                   and
                              most obedient
                                 Subject

                            _NEHEMJAH GREW._




                                   THE
                                 PREFACE.


It is a _Politick_ or _Civil Virtue_ in every prudent mans Eye, To set
himself an example, in what he doth, unto others. And in so doing, he
looks upon himself as accountable, in some sort, to all Men. To those
therefore, who may either expresly, or tacitly, expect the Reasons,
upon which I first undertook the _Anatomy_ of _Plants_, and also made
the after-progress therein; I shall summe them up as follows.

The first occasion of directing my Thoughts this way, was in the
_Year 1664_, upon reading some, of the many and curious Inventions of
Learned Men, in the _Bodies_ of _Animals_. For considering, that both
of them came at first out of the same _Hand_; and were therefore the
_Contrivances_ of the same _Wisdom_: I thence fully assured my self,
that it could not be a vain Design; to seek it in both. And being
then newly furnished with a good stock of _Seeds_, in order to raise
a _Nursery_ of _Plants_; I resolved, besides what I first aimed at,
to make the utmost use of them for that purpose: that so I might put
somewhat upon that side the _Leaf_ which the best _Botanicks_ had left
bare and empty. And in which, notwithstanding some other Learned Men
had inferred somewhat of this nature; as Dr. _Highmore_ in his _Book_
of _Generation_, Dr. _Sharrock_ of the _Propagation_ of _Plants_, and
Mr. _Hook_ in his _Micrography_: yet but collaterally, and whithout
shewing any purpose of managing this _Part_ of _Natural History_. And
although it seemed at first an Objection in my way, That the first
projectors seldome bring their business to any good end: yet I also
knew, That if Men should stay for an Example in every thing; nothing
extraordinary would ever be done.

But notwithstanding the reasonableness of the Design; yet I did not
forget, that, in respect of the Undertaker, there might be _Impar
congressus_. And therefore, before I had ventured very far, in the
Year 1668, I imparted it to my Brother-in-Law, the Learned Dr. _Henry
Sampson_, now _Fellow_ of the _Colledge_ of _Physicians_ in _London_.
Who not only very well liked the same; but also excited me to a
vigorous and accurate prosecution of it. Which he did, partly, by
mentioning a very pertinent passage of Dr. _Glisson_, in the _Preface_
to his _Book de Hepate_,[1] which I had not then read.

  _Plantæ quoque in hunc censum_ (sc. Anatomicum) _veniunt; variâ enim
  Partium texturâ, & differentiis constant: & proculdubio, ex acurata
  earundem dissectione, utiles valde observationes nobis exurgerent:
  præstaretque in illis (inferioris licet ordinis) rebus examinandis
  operam impendere, quam in transcribendis ut sæpe sit, aliorum
  laboribus, inutiliter ætatem transigere. Quippe hoc pacto, ignavarum
  apum more, aliena duntaxat alvearia expilamus, nihilque bono publico
  adjicimus._

     [1] Ch. 1.

After I had finished the _First Book_, that I might know the sense also
of other Learned Men, whether the steps I had already taken, would
warrant me to proceed any further: I put some part of it into the same
Hand; who, in the Year 1670, communicated the same to Mr. _Oldenburge_,
then _Secretary_ to the _Royal Society_: and after he had read it over,
it was, upon his motion, delivered to that excellent Person Dr. _John
Wilkins_ then _Bishop_ of _Chester_; who produced it at a Meeting of
the _Royal Society_, and desired, they might see the rest. Which, or
the greatest part, being also presented to them, the Right Honourable
the Lord Vicount _Brouncker_, then _President_ of the _Royal Society_,
was pleased to peruse the same. Presently, after which, at a Meeting of
the Council of the said _Society_, the following _Order_ was made, and
entred in their Council-Book with this Date, and in these words:

                            _May 11ᵗʰ 1671._

    _Then was Licensed Dr._ Nehemjah Grew’_s Book, Entituled,_ The
  Anatomy of Vegetables _begun; together with an account of_ Vegetation
  _grounded thereupon. And Ordered to be Printed by the Printer to the_
  Royal Society.

Hereupon, I was obliged to send the Book to the Press. And upon the 9ᵗʰ
of _November_ following in the same Year 1671, when it was near being
printed, my Lord _Brouncher_ signed the forementioned _Order_: the
Printer, whose Name was to be inserted therein, not having received his
_Diploma_ till that time.

The Book being quickly after printed off; I ordered it to be Presented
to the _Royal Society_; which was accordingly done at one of their
Meetings _December 7, 1671_. And also to be sent to the Bishop of
_Chester_; who was pleased to signifie his acceptance thereof by a
Letter dated at _Chester_, _December_ 26ᵗʰ 1671. now filed amongst
others in the Custody of the _Royal Society_: part whereof, in regard
it relates to matter of Fact, I shall here recite.

     Sir,

  _I did yesterday receive your Book; and am very sensible of the
  Honour you have done me in the Dedication of it. You was very happy
  in the choice of this Subject to write upon; one of the most Noble
  and the most Copious parts of_ Philosophy; _and such an one, as hath
  hitherto lain uncultivated. And you have been very successful in
  your first Attempt about it, in so many remarkable Observations and
  Discoveries, as you have made already. I could heartily wish, that
  you would still apply your self to this kind of Enquiries. You will
  find that Additionals will come in more copiously and easily. And it
  is not fit, that any one should, by his Superstructions, carry away
  the praise from him, who was the first Inventor, and who laid the
  Foundations, wherein the greatest difficulty doth consist, &c._

Having thus submitted my self to the Judgment of many Learned Men; I
saw that my Journey must not here end. So that, like one who is got
into a Wood, I thought I might as fairly find my way out, by going on,
as by making a retreat. Whereupon, I began to draw up a _Scheme_ of the
whole _Design_.

While I was doing this, I received news from _London_, that the same
day, _December 7. 1671_, in which my Book, then printed, was presented
to the _Royal Society_: there was also presented a _Manuscript_
(without _Figures_) from Seignior _Malpighi_, upon the same Subject;
dated at _Bononia_, _November,_ 1ˢᵗ 1671. the same, which Mr.
_Oldenburge_, when it came to be printed, calleth his _Idea_. And of
this, entry was made in their Journal Book. So that the _Royal Society_
having now a Prospect of the good service of an Ancient _Member_, and
one, who had highly merited by his Works then extant; from thence
forward, I looked upon my self to be excused.

But soon after, receiving another Letter from the Bishop of _Chester_,
dated at _London_, _Febr. 18. 1672_. I found the matter otherwise; and
that the _Society_ were pleased to engage me to proceed. Whereof entry
was made by the _Secretary_ in their Journal Book, at one of their
Meetings, _April, 18. 1672_, in these words:

  _The_ Society _was made acquainted with one particular lately passed
  in the Council;_ sc. _That the Bishop of_ Chester _had there proposed
  Dr._ Grew _to be a Curator to the_ Royal Society _for the_ Anatomy
  _of_ Plants: _and that the Council had approved of that_ Proposal.
  _Upon which, it was Ordered, That the Thanks of the_ Society _be
  returned to the Lord Bishop of_ Chester, _for this_ Proposal, _and to
  the Council for their Approbation of the same._

This they might be induced to do; upon considering, that it would be
no disadvantage to the credit of those matters, which were so new and
strange, to be offered to the World from a double Authority. For one,
although he may have no mind to deceive; yet is it more likely for one,
than for two, to be deceived. Likewise, that the same Subject, being
prosecuted by two Hands, would be the more illustrated by the different
Examples produced by both. And that, as in other matters, so here, the
defects of both, would mutually be supplyed.

Whether for these, or other Reasons also, they were pleased to pass the
forementioned _Order_; that being done, it had been very ill manners
in me, not to have answered their expectation therein. And therefore
reassuming the Design I had laid by, and having reduced it to some
intelligible _Idea_, it was submitted to the Censure of the _Royal
Society_: and it was thereupon ordered it should be printed.

Not long after, I received a Curious and Learned Book from Mons.
_Dodart_, _Archiater_ to the Prince of _Conde_, and _Fellow_ of the
_Royal Academy_ at _Paris_; in persuance of whose Order, it was by him
composed and published. Which being a Design of a like Import, I was
glad to see it so far justify’d by that Illustrious _Society_, as well
as by our own.

In this _Idea_, one principal Thing I insist upon, for a _Philosophical
History_ of _Plants_, is _Anatomy_. And, agreeing to the _Method_
therein proposed, all the Observations conteined in the _First Book_,
except one or two, were made with the _Naked Eye_. To the end, I might
first give a proof, How far it was possible for us to go, without
the help of _Glasses_: which many Ingenious Men want; and more, the
patience to manage them. For the Truth of these Observations, Seignior
_Malpighi_, having procured my Book to be translated into Latin for
his private use, speaks his own sense, in some of his Letters to Mr.
_Oldenburge_, printed at the end of his _Anatomy_ of _Plants_. And some
of them, have since been confirmed, both by our Learned Country-men
Dr. _Wallis_, and Mr. _Lister_; and by the Ingenious Mr. _Lewenhoeck_,
abroad.

Having thus begun with the bare Eye; I next proceeded to the use of the
_Microscope_. And the Observations thereby made, first on _Roots_, and
afterwards on _Trunks_ and _Branches_, together with the _Figures_,
were all exhibited to the _Royal Society_ at several times from _May
15. 1672._ to _April 2. 1674_; being the _Materials_ for the _Second_
and _Third Parts_: and hereof _Memorials_ were inserted in their
Journal Books.

After this, the _Royal Society_ received from Seignior _Malpighi_ his
_Second Part_ of the _Anatomy_ of _Plants_, together with the _Figures_
therein described, and his _Letters_ to their _Secretary_, dated at
_Bononia_ _Aug. 20ᵗʰ_ of the same year 1674. when, and not before, he
gave leave that the two said _Parts_ should be printed.

So soon as I had finished the _Second_ and _Third Parts_, I proceeded
to the _Last_, _sc._ of _Leaves_, _Flowers_, _Fruits_ and _Seeds_: and
those Things I met with, more remarquable, were presented to the said
_Society_ in the Years 1676 & 1677. And the publishing of the former
_Parts_ successively, as well as of all together, hath been done in
pursuance of their several _Orders_ for the same.

Having concluded the _History_ of _Perfect Plants_; I intended to have
subjoyned the _Description_ of those which are _Imperfect_. As also of
_Parasitical_, _Marine_, and _Sensitive Plants_. And lastly, a view
of the chief Particulars, wherein the _Mechanisme_ of a _Plant_, is
different from that of an _Animal_. But these things I leave to some
other Hand.

The _First Book_, a little after it came forth; was translated into
the French _Tongue_, by Mons. Le _Vasseur_ an Ingenious Gentleman in
_Paris_; elegantly, and in the Judgment of those who are well skilled
in that _Language_, with much exactness, as to the sense. He having
taken special care, to have all the difficulties of our own, by Me,
cleared to him. And in a late Book Entituled, _Philosophia vetus &
nova_ printed at _Noriberg_ 1682. the Learned Author seems to have made
use of this Translation, for all that he hath taken notice of in that
my _First Book_.

By the Ingenious Collectors of the _German Ephemerides_, both my
_First_, _Second_, and _Third Books_, are all published in _Latine_.
But their unskilful Interpreter doth often fail of the _Grammatical
Sense_. Whose Errors, many of them very gross, I desire may be imputed
neither to them, nor to my self.

Besides these, the _Second Lecture_ of _Mixture_ is also translated
into _French_, by Mons. _Mesmin_ a Learned Physician in _Paris_: whose
_Version_ is very well approved by those who are competent Judges
hereof.

This, and the rest which follow, are placed, not in the order of
_Time_; but more according to their Nature or Relation one to another.
All of them intended as a Commentary upon some particulars mentioned,
either in the _First Lecture_, or in the _Idea_.

In the _Plates_, for the clearer conception of the _Part_ described,
I have represented it, generally, as entire, as its being magnified
to some good degree, would bear. So, for instance, not the _Barque_,
_Wood_, or _Pith_ of a _Root_ or _Tree_, by it self; but at least, some
portion of all three together: Whereby, both their _Texture_, and also
their Relation one to another, and the _Fabrick_ of the whole, may be
observed at one _View_. Yet have I not every where magnify’d the _Part_
to the same degree; but more or less, as was necessary to represent
what is spoken of it. And very highly, only in some few Examples, as
in _Tab. 40._ which may suffice to illustrate the rest. Some of the
_Plates_, especially those which I did not draw to the _Engravers_
hand, are a little hard and stiff: but they are all well enough done,
to represent what they intend.

                          Philosophical History

                                   OF

                                 PLANTS.


IF WE take an account of the _Degrees_ whereunto the Knowledge
of _Vegetables_ is Advanced, it appeareth, That besides the
great Varieties, which the Successful _Arts_ of _Florists_, or
Transplantations from one _Climate_ to another, have produced; we
have very many _Species_ brought to light, especially Natives of the
_Indies_, which the _Ancients_, for any thing that appears in their
_Writings_ now extant, were ignorant of. In which particular _Clusius_,
_Columna_, _Baubinus_, _Boccone_, and others, have performed much.
Withall, That their _Descriptions_ (of all Parts above ground) their
_Places_ and _Seasons_, are with good diligence and preciseness set
before us. Likewise their Order and Kindred: for the adjusting whereof
our Learned Countryman Mr. _Ray_, and Dr. _Morrison_, have both taken
very laudable pains. As also the ordering of them with respect to
their _Alimental_ and _Mechanick_ Uses; for which, amongst others, Mr.
_Evelyn_ and Dr. _Beal_ have deserved many thanks, and great praise.
We are also informed, of the _Natures_ and infallible _Faculties_ of
_many_ of them. Whereunto so many as have assisted, have much obliged
their _Posterity_.

2. §. By due Reflection upon what hath been _Performed_; it also
appears, what is left _Imperfect_, and what _Undone_. For the _Virtues_
of most _Plants_, are with much _uncertainty_, and too _promiscuously_
ascribed to them. So that if you turn over an _Herbal_, you shall
find almost every _Herb_, to be good for every _Disease_. And of the
_Virtues_ of many, they are altogether silent. And although, for the
finding out, and just appropriation of them, they have left us some
_Rules_, yet not all. The _Descriptions_ likewise of many, are yet to
be perfected; especially as to their Roots. Those who are very curious
about the other _Parts_, being yet here too remiss. And as for their
_Figures_, it were much to be wished, That they were all drawn by
one _Scale_; or, at most, by Two; one, for _Trees_ and _Shrubs_; and
another for _Herbs_. Many likewise of their _Ranks_ and _Affinities_,
are yet undetermined. And a great number of _Names_, both _English_ and
_Latine_, not well given. So what we call _Goat’s-Rue_, is not at all
of kin to that Plant, whose _Generical Name_ it bears. The like may be
said of _Wild-Tansy_, _Stock-July-Flowers_, _Horse-Radish_, and many
more. So also when we say _Bellis Major_, & _Minor_, as we commonly
do, these _Names_ would intimate, That the _Plants_ to which they are
given, differ (as the great double _Marigold_, doth from the less)
only in Bulk: whereas, in truth, they are two _Species_ of _Plants_.
So we commonly say, _Centaurium Majus & Minus_, _Chelidonium Majus &
Minus_, and of others in like manner, which yet are distinct _Species_,
and of very different _Tribes_. But for the _Reason_ of _Vegetation_,
and the _Causes_ of all those infinite _Varieties_ therein observable
(I mean so far as _Matter_, and the various _Affections_ hereof, are
instrumental thereunto) almost all Men have seemed to be unconcerned.

3. §. That Nothing hereof remaineth further to be known, is a Thought
not well Calculated. For if we consider how long and gradual a
_Journey_ the _Knowledge_ of _Nature_ is; and how short a Time we have
to proceed therein; as on the one hand, we shall conclude it our ease
and profit, To see how far Others have gone before us: so shall we
beware on the other, That we conceive not unduly of _Nature_, whilst
we have a just value for Those, who were but her _Disciples_, and
instructed by Her. Their Time and Abilities both, being short to her;
which, as She was first Designed by _Divine Wisdom_; so may Her vast
Dimensions best be adjudged of, in being compared Therewith. It will
therefore be our Prudence, not to insist upon the Invidious Question,
Which of Her _Scholars_ have taken the fairest measure of Her; but to
be well satisfied, that as yet She hath not been Circumscribed by Any.

4. §. Nor doth it more behove us to consider, how much of the Nature of
_Vegetation_ may lie before us yet _unknown_; Than, to believe, a great
part thereof to be _knowable_. Not concluding from the acknowledged,
much less supposed Insuccessfulnes, of any Mens Undertakings: but from
what may be accounted Possible, as to the Nature of things themselves;
and from _Divine Providence_, by Infinite Ways conducting to the
knowledge of them. Neither can we determine how great a part This may
be: Because, _It is impossible to Measure, what we See not_. And since
we are most likely to under-measure, we shall hereby but intrench our
Endeavours, which we are not wont to carry beyond the _Idea_, which we
have of our _Work_.

5. §. And how far soever this kind of Knowledge may be attainable, its
being so far also worthy our attainment will be granted. For beholding
the Many and Elegant Varieties, wherewith a Field or Garden is adorned;
Who would not say, That it were exceeding pleasant to know what we
Se_e_: and not more delightful, to one who has _Eyes_, to discern that
all is very fine; than to another who hath _Reason_, to understand
_how_. This surely were for a Man to take a True Inventory of his
Goods, and his best way to put a price upon them. Yea it seems, that
this were not only to be _Partaker of Divine Bounty_; but also, in some
degree, _To be Copartner in the Secrets of Divine Art_. That which were
very desireable, unless we should think it impertinent for us to design
the _Knowing_ of _That_, which _God_ hath once thought fit to _Do_.

6. §. If for these, and other _Reasons_, an inquiry into the Nature
of _Vegetation_ may be of good Import; It will be requisite to
see, first of all, What may offer it self to be enquired of; or to
understand, what our _Scope_ is: That so doing, we may take our aim
the better in making, and having made, in applying our Observations
thereunto. Amongst other Inquiries therefore, such as these deserve to
be proposed. First, by what means it is that a _Plant_, or any _Part_
of it, comes to _Grow_, a _Seed_ to put forth a _Root_ and _Trunk_;
and this, all the other _Parts_, to the _Seed_ again; and all these
being _formed_, by continual Nutrition still to be _increased_. How
the Aliment by which a _Plant_ is fed, is duly prepared in its several
_Parts_; which way it is _conveyed_ unto them; and in what manner
it is _assimilated_ to their respective Natures in them all. Whence
this Growth and Augmentation, is not made of one, but many differing
Degrees, unto both extremes of _small_ and _great_; whether the
comparison be made betwixt several _Plants_, or the several _Parts_
of one. How not only their _Sizes_, but also their _Shapes_ are so
exceeding various; as of _Roots_, in being Thick or Slender, Short
or Long, Entire or Parted, Stringed or Ramified, and the like: of
_Trunks_, some being more Entire, others Branched, others Shrub’d:
of _Leaves_, which are Long or Round, Even-edg’d or Escallop’d, and
many other ways different, yet always Flat: and so for the other
_Parts_. Then to inquire, What should be the reason of their various
_Motions_; that the _Root_ should _descend_; that its descent should
sometimes be _perpendicular_, sometimes more _level_: That the _Trunk_
doth _ascend_; and that the ascent thereof, as to the space of _Time_
wherein it is made, is of different _measures_: and of divers other
_Motions_, as they are observable in the _Roots_, _Trunks_, and
other _Parts_ of _Plants_. Whence again, these _Motions_ have their
Different, and Stated _Terms_; that _Plants_ have their set and
peculiar _Seasons_ for their _Spring_ or _Birth_, for their _Full
Growth_, and for their _Teeming_; and the like. Further, what may be
the Causes as of the _Seasons_ of their _Growth_; so of the _Periods_
of their _Lives_; some being _Annual_, others _Biennial_, others
_Perennial_; some _Perennial_ both as to their _Roots_ and _Trunks_;
and some as to their _Roots_ only. Then, as they pass through these
several _Seasons_ of their _Lives_, in what manner their convenient
_feeding_, _housing_, _cloathing_ or _protection_ otherwise, is
contrived; wherein, in this kind and harmonious _Oeconomy_, one _Part_,
may be officious to another, for the preservation of the health and
life of the _whole_. And lastly, what care is taken, not only for
themselves, but for their _Posterity_; in what manner the _Seed_ is
prepared, formed and fitted for _Propagation_: and this being of so
great concernment, how sometimes the other _Parts_ also, as _Roots_,
in putting forth _Trunks_; _Trunks_ in putting forth _Roots_; yea in
turning oftentimes into _Roots_ themselves; whereof, in the _Second
Book of the Anatomy of Plants_, I shall give some instances. With other
_Heads_ of Inquiry of this kind.

7. §. Nor are the _Natures_, _Faculties_, and _Contents_ of
_Vegetables_ less various, or a particular Inspection hereinto, of
less concernment. For since All, or Most, seem to grow in the same
manner, with one _Sun_, one _Rain_, indifferently well upon one
_Soil_, and, to outward appearance, to have the same _Common Parts_;
it may be asked, _How_ it comes to pass that their _Liquors_, or other
_Contained Parts_, are of such different _Kinds_; one being _Watry_,
another _Winy_, a third _Oily_, a fourth _Milky_, and the like.
_How_ also there is such a variety in their _Sensible Qualities_, as
their _Colours_, _Tastes_, and _Smells_; what those _Materials_ are,
which are necessary to the _Being_ of these _Qualities_; and those
_Formalities_, wherein their _Essence_ doth consist; as what it is that
makes a _Plant_, or _Flower_, to be _white_ or _red_; _fragrant_ or
_fetid_; _bitter_ or _sweet_; or to be of any other _Colour_, _Smell_,
or _Taste_. In like manner, their _Faculties_ and _Powers_, what that
is, or those things are, by which they are constituted; as whence one
becomes _Purgative_, another _Vomitory_, a third _Diaphoretick_, _&c._,
These, I say, with many other particular Inquiries depending hereupon;
as they cannot but much oblige the Reason of Man to be obsequious to
them, so by bringing in, at least, some satisfaction, will no less
reward it. Especially, if it be withal considered, that besides our
satisfaction as to the _Nature_ of _Vegetation_; some further Light, to
divers other parts of Knowledge, may likewise hence arise.

8. § For since the present Design will ingage us, to an accurate and
multifarious Observation of _Plants_; we may hereby be enabled to
_range_ and _sort_ them with more certainty, according to the Degrees
of their _Affinity_. And all _Exoticks_, _Plants_ or _Parts_ of
_Plants_, may probably be reduced to some such _Domesticks_, unto which
they may bear the best Resemblance. Again, it may frequently conduct
our minds to the consideration of the _State_ of _Animals_; as whether
there are not divers material Agreements betwixt them both; and what
they are. _Wherein_ also they may considerably differ, and what those
things are which are more essential to their distinguishment. And
_besides_, not only to compare what is already known of both; but also,
by what may be observed in the _one_, to suggest and facilitate the
finding out of what may yet be unobserved in the _other_. So _also_ the
consideration of the _Colours_, _Smells_, and _Tastes_ of _Vegetables_,
may conduce to the Knowledge of the same _Qualities_ in General; or of
what it is, that constitutes them such, in any other Body: not as they
are _actually_ received by _Sense_; but so far, as such _Materials_ or
external _Circumstances_, are requisite to their becoming the _Adequate
Objects_ thereof. _It may_ lead us also to inquire into further Ways of
_Cultivation_, with respect to the whole _Plant_, or to the _Flower_,
_Fruit_, or other _Part_: To amend them as to their _Sizes_, _Colours_,
_Tastes_, _Fruitfulness_, or otherwise: To think of other Ways of
_Propagation_; or to apply those already known to other _Plants_
than hath been used. Likewise the Knowledge of their _Mechanical_
Uses may hereby be enlarged; both as to the Reason of their use, in
such particular _Trades_ and _Manufactures_, already known; and the
discovery of other uses yet unknown. As also their _Alimental_, with
respect both to _Meats_ and _Drinks_; the preparation of some, and
the finding out of others. But especially their _Medicinal_; some
_Plants_ which have hitherto been neglected, may be applied to use; the
_Perverted_ uses of some, and the _Confused_ uses of others, may be
rectified. What may best correct their _Malignancies_, or inforce their
_Virtues_; When needful to add the preparations of _Art_ to That of
_Nature_; How to Enlarge those of _Art_, and Rectifie those which are
indeed Inartificial, may hereby be better conjectured. The knowledge of
all which, that we may know how far it is accessible, and what probable
Approaches may be made towards it; those several Means I have thought
of, and suppose necessary thereunto, are next to be proposed.

9. §. Reflecting then upon the present Design, and seeing this to lie
wide; we shall, in the first place, conclude the _Means_ attending
thereon, should do so likewise. Wherefore, although some may present
themselves unto us as more promising; yet let us suppose what several
Persons, were they hereunto engaged, each according to his Sense
and Genius, would possibly make choice of. Believing, that although
Considering Men may vary, in the approval of their own Sense and
Notion; yet not always mearly, because it is their own; but because
each, may probably see somewhat more in his own, than others do.
Wherefore it will be our surest Logick to conclude, Not because no
_Mean_ may be approved by all Men, that all _Means_ should be rejected;
but rather, because each may be approved by some, that therefore,
all be made choice of. And these, I think, may be comprehended under
Five General _Heads_ of Enquiry. _First_, Of those Things, which are
of more _External_ Consideration about _Plants_, as their _Figures_,
_&c._ _Secondly_, Of their Compounding _Parts_, as _Vessels_, _&c._
_Thirdly_, Of their _Liquors_, and other _Contents_. _Fourthly_, Of
their _Principles_, as _Salts_, _&c._ _Fifthly_, Of their _Aliment_, as
_Water_, and other Means of Growth.

10. §. AND FIRST of all, whatever is of more _External_ Consideration,
♦ The First General _Mean_. ♦ as the _Figures_, _Proportions_,
_Motions_, _Seasons_, _Situations_ of _Vegetables_, and of their
several _Parts_, should be observed. In doing which, a particular
survey of all their Varieties should be taken. And then a Comparison
made betwixt these, and the several _Plants_, or _Parts_ of _Plants_,
whereof they are the _Properties_. To the end, We may, if possible, be
thereby conducted to find out, what other, either sensible, or more
recluse _Property_, any of them may agree together in. For it is not
more certain, that the three Angles of every _Rectilinear Triangle_,
because all ways equal to two _Right Angles_, are therefore, if put
together, always the same: than that _one Property_, agreeing to
divers _Vegetables_, should have one _Cause_: For although the _Scope_
and _End_ may vary; yet the _Cause_, as it is the _Cause_ of that
_Property_, must be _one_: and consequently, must also import some
_Identity_ in the _Nature_ of all those _Vegetables_ wherein it Acts.
Wherefore by thus comparing of them, we shall be able more exactly
to state the _Orders_ and _Degrees_ of their _Affinities_; Better to
understand both the _Causes_ and _Ends_ of their _Varieties_: And more
probably to conjecture of their _Natures_ and _Vertues_.

11. §. First then the various _Figures_ of their several _Parts_
should be observed; and that with respect both to the _Forms_, and the
_Positions_, by which their _Roots_, _Trunks_, _Branches_, _Leaves_,
_Flowers_, _Fruits_, and _Seeds_ may vary, or agree; and those several
_Lines_, by which both the said _Varieties_ are determin’d. In which
of these _Parts_, the agreement chiefly lies; this being both more
observable, and more material in some of them; less in the Root, more
in the Flower, or Seed. And in how many of these _Parts_ together;
whether one, more, or all. By both which, the _Orders_ and _Degrees_
of _Affinity_, which are many, may be accounted; either as to what
we strictly call _Kindred_, or else _Analogy_. For there are found,
not only _Herbs_ accounted of several _Tribes_, which are ally’d; and
some of the Smallest, which are of kin to the Greatest: But there are
also, probably, some _Herbs_, which have a particular Relation, to
many Kinds of _Shrubs_; and some _Shrubs_, to many Kinds of _Trees_.
Thus the several sorts of _Letuce_, are of Kin, together in the _First
Degree_; with _Endive_, in the _Second_. The several _Clarys_, amongst
themselves in the _First_; with _Horehound_, in the _Second_; with
_Lamium_, in the _Third_. All _Strawberries_ agree together, in the
_First_ Degree; with _Cinquefoyl_, in the _Second_; with _Tormentil_
in the _Third_; and with _Avens_, _&c._ in other Degrees more remote.
So _Agrimony_, hath alike Analogy unto _Strawberry_; as _Goats-Rue_,
hath to _Claver_: And _Strawberry_, the like unto the _Rasp_; as
_Goosberry_ to the _Vine_; or _Burnet_, to the _Rose_. Amongst the
several _Sorts_ of _Grass_, there are some which match all those of
_Corn_; which is but a greater kind of _Grass_. So again all _Pulse_,
are not only of kin, in their several Degrees, to one another; but
likewise, to almost all kinds of _Trefoyls_, as _Melilot_, _Fœnugreek_,
and the common _Clavers_ themselves; as by comparing not only their
_Leaves_, but _Flowers_, _Seeds_, and _Cods_ together, may be evident.
For the several _parts_ of the _Flower_ of a _Trefoyl_, are so many
more _Flowers_, containing so many _Cods_ of small _Seeds_, all, in
shape, agreeable to the _Flowers_, _Cods_, and _Seeds_ of _Pulse_. The
same Relation, which _Trefoyls_ have to the _Peas_ or other _Pulse_;
_Colts-foot_, hath to _Buttyr-Bur_; _Chickweed_ to _Leucanthemum_;
_Groundsell_, to _Jacobæa_; or _Scorodonia_, to _Foxglove_: Or, to go
higher, as the _Leguminous_ Kinds of _Herbs_, have to _Sena_, or some
other of the _Lobed Shrubs_ and _Trees_. And, as among _Animals_, there
are some which connect several Kinds; as the _Batt_ doth _Beasts_ and
_Birds_: So, among _Plants_, there are some also, which seem to stand
between two _Tribes_; as _Lappa_, between _Knapweeds_ and _Thistles_;
_Lampsana_, between the _Intybaceous_ Kind, and the _Mouse-ears_.

12. §. From hence likewise, the _Natures_ of _Plants_ may be
conjectured. For in looking upon divers _Plants_, though of different
_Names_ and _Kinds_; yet if some affinity may be found betwixt them,
then the _Nature_ of any one of them being well known, we have thence
ground of conjecture, as to the _Nature_ of all the rest. So that
as every _Plant_ may have somewhat of _Nature individual_ to it
self; so, as far as it obtaineth any _Visible Communities_ with other
_Plants_, so far, may it partake of _Common Nature_ with those also.
Thus the _Wild_, and _Garden Cucumers_, have this difference; that
the one _purgeth_ strongly, the other, _not at all_: yet in being
_Diuretick_, they both agree. The _Natures_ of _Umbelliferous Plants_,
we know, are various; yet ’tis most probable, that they all agree in
this one, _scil._ in being _Carminative_. The several sorts, both of
_Corn_ and _Grass_, are all akin; there is no doubt therefore, but that
the _Seeds_ of _Grass_ themselves (of _Rye_ and _Oats_ it is tryed)
if it were worth the while to order them, as _Barley_, would yield an
inflammable Spirit. So likewise the several Kinds of _Pulse_, have some
one community in their Form, as is said: for which reason, I question
not, but that in some Cases, wherein _Cicers_ are esteemed a good
_Medicine_; a _Decoction_ of the better sort of _Pease_, especially
that we call the _Sugar-Pease_, may go beyond them. As doth also the
_Flower_ or _Meal_ of _Beans_, that of the _Seeds_ of _Fœnugreek_; even
there, where they are accounted excellent. So _Tulips_, _Lillies_,
_Crocuses_, _Jacynths_, and _Onions_ themselves, with many others,
in their several Degrees, are all _allied_. If therefore _Crocuses_,
_Onions_, _Lillies_, agree in one or more _Faculties_, then why may
not all the rest? as in being _Anodyne_; or in some other _Common
Nature_; whereby, in their _Vegetation_, their _Parts_ are Governed and
Over-ruled, to one Common or _Analogous Form_.

13. §. The _Proportions_ likewise, amongst the several _Parts_ of
_Vegetables_, for the same Reasons, deserve to be observed; the
comparison being made, both betwixt the _Parts_ of several _Plants_,
and the several _Parts_ of one. And here again, either betwixt any Two
of the _Parts_, or any One of them, and the Whole besides, or all the
rest put together. So some larger _Seeds_, produce a small _Root_; as
those of _Cucumer_: and others smaller, produce one very great; as
those of _Bryony_. Some _Plants_, as the _Melon_, though themselves
but very slender, yet have a vast and bulky _Fruit_; others again,
as _Thistles_, and many yet more substantial, have no other _Fruit_,
besides their _Seed_. So the _Seeds_ of all _Pulse_, and especially,
the _Garden Bean_, though large, yet produce but a small _Plant_: but
those of _Foxglove_, _Mullen_, _Burdock_, _Sun-flower_, _&c._ being
themselves much less, do yet produce a far greater. And especially,
those _Seeds_, which are inclosed in the Thicker sort of _Cover_,
(analogous to that I have elsewhere called the _Secondine_) as that of
_Peony_; ♦ Anat. Plant. Book I. Chap. ult. ♦ whose _Seed_, so called,
is only the _Nest_ wherein the true and real _Seed_ is lodged, no
bigger than a little Pins head: which is also observable of the _Seeds_
of divers other _Plants_. These, and the like _Proportions_, as they
lie betwixt the several _Parts_, should be noted: and to what _Plants_
or _Parts_ especially, any of them may agree: comparing also in what
other kind of _Properties_ an agreement betwixt the said _Parts_
may be found: that so doing, we may, if possible, amongst all their
_Individual Natures_, be instructed to single out those _Common Ones_,
which are concomitant to such Agreeing _Properties_.

14. §. The several _Seasons_ also of _Plants_, and of their _Parts_,
should be considered. Observing at what particular Times of the Year,
any of them chiefly _Spring_, Early or Late. The Times wherein they
_Germinate_; whether for some Space only, or all the Year long. Wherein
they _Spring_, after Sowing; or _Flower_, after Springing, sooner,
or slower. Which Flower, the _first_ Year, or not till the _second_.
Which _after_ the _Leaves_ are put forth, or _before_ them; for so,
some do, as the _Crocus Vernus_, _Bears-foot_, _Hepatica aurea_, and
others; all the _Leaves_, at the time of their flowering, being old,
or of the foregoing Year’s growth. So likewise the _Maturation_ of
the _Fruit_ or _Seed_; how long after the _Flower_, and the like. All
or some of which _Varieties_, being laid together, we may probably
conjecture the _Causes_ thereof, and the _Natures_ of the _Plants_ in
which they are seen: _scil._ as such a Degree of Heat may be necessary
for the Fermentation, or the better Distribution of the _Sap_ of such a
_Plant_; or for the Impregnation of the _Aer_, to be mixed therewith;
or the due Disposing of the _Soil_, to render the most convenient
Aliment thereunto. So the _Principles_ of such _Plants_, which flower
all the Year, may be more equally proportion’d. Those which flower
before the _Leaves_ put forth, as the _Crocus Vernus_, and those which
flower in _Spring_, may be accounted _Rank_, and full of _Volatile
Salt_. But _Autumn Plants_ especially, to abound with a Fixed: and the
like.

15. §. The proper _Places_ also of _Plants_, or such wherein they
have, from their _Seeds_, or other way of _Propagation_, a Spontaneous
growth, should be considered. And that as to the _Climate_; whether in
one Colder, Temperate, or more Hot. The _Region_; Continent, or Island.
The _Seat_; as Sea, or Land, Watry, Boggy, or Dry; Hills, Plains, or
Vallies; Open, in Woods, or under Hedges; Against _Walls_, rooted
in them, or on their Tops: and the like. And perhaps the _Seeds_ of
some _Plants_, as of _Mosses_, (which, through their smallness, will
ascend like Moths in the Sun) may fly or swim for some time, in the
Aer, _viz._ till they begin to shoot, and so become heavy enough, to
fall down upon the Ground. From whence, in like manner, as from their
_Seasons_, their particular _Natures_ may be directed unto. In that,
so far as we may conjecture the nature of such an _Aer_, _Soil_, or
_Seat_, we may also of such a _Plant_, to which they are _congenial_.

16. §. So likewise, those many Varieties observable in the _Motions_
of _Plants_, and of their Parts, both Kinds and Degrees; _Ascending_,
_Descending_, and _Horizontal_; _Rectilinear_, and _Spiral Motions_,
should be noted; to what _Plants_ they agree, and wherein any of
these Motions may be analogous to those of _Animals_. And in a word,
any other _Forensick Properties_ of _Plants_. And then, to Compare
them all together; both being necessary. For _Thoughts_ cannot work
upon nothing, no more than _Hands_. He that will build an House, must
provide Materials. And on the contrary, the Materials will never become
an House, unless, by certain Rules, we joyn them all together. So, it
is not, _simply_, the Knowledge of _many things_, but a multifarious
Copulation of them in the Mind, that becomes prolifick of further
Knowledge. And thus much for the first General _Mean_.

17. §. THE NEXT which I propose, and that a most necessary one, is
_Anatomy_. ♦ The Second General _Mean_. ♦ For when upon the Dissection
of _Vegetables_, we see so great a difference in them, that not only
their Outward _Figures_, but also their Inward _Structure_, is so
Elegant; and in all, so Various; it must needs lead us thus to Think,
That these Inward _Varieties_, were either to no _End_; or if they
were, we must assign to what. To imagine the first, were exceeding
vain; as if _Nature_, the Handmaid of _Divine Wisdom_, should with Her
fine _Needle_ and _Thred_, stitch up so many several _Pieces_, of so
difficult, and yet so groundless a Work. But if for some _End_, then
either only to be looked upon, or some other besides. If for this only,
then this must be such as in respect whereof, Her Work is at no time,
nor in any degree frustrate; the contrary whereunto, is most manifest.
For although Men do every where, with frequent pleasure, behold the
Outward Elegancies of _Plants_; yet the Inward Ones, which, generally,
are as Precise and Various as the Outward; we see, how usual it is,
for the beholding of These, to be omitted by them. And besides, when
we have observed _Nature’s_ Work, as well as we can; it may be no
impediment to our best Endeavours, to believe, That some Parts of it,
will still remain behind, _Unseen_. So that if to be _Seen_, were the
only End of it, it must needs be wholly frustrate, as to the greater
number of Men; and, in some part, as to all. Wherefore, we must suppose
some other _Ends_ of the said Varieties, which should have their
_Effect_, and so These, not be in vain, whether Men beheld them or not;
which, are, therefore, such as have respect to _Vegetation_: That the
_Corn_ might grow, _so_; and the _Flower_, _so_, whether or no Men had
a mind, leisure, or ability, to understand _how_.

18. §. If then the _Anatomy_ of _Vegetables_ be so useful a _Mean_, we
ought not to streighten it; but to force this, as well as the rest,
to its utmost Extent. And therefore, first of all, To go through all
the _Parts_, with equal care; examining the _Root_, _Trunk_, _Branch_,
_Leaf_, _Flower_, _Fruit_, and _Seed_. Then to Repeat or Retrograde
the Dissection, from _Part_ to _Part_: in that, although the best
Method of Delivery, for clear Discourse, can be but one, according to
that of _Nature_, from the _Seed_ forward, to the _Seed_: yet can it
not but be useful, for That of Dissection, to proceed _to_ and _fro_;
somewhat or other being more Visible in each several _Part_, from
whence still an Hint may be taken, for the ushering in the observation
of it in the others. To examine, again, not only all the _Parts_,but
_Kinds_ of _Vegetables_, and comparatively, to observe divers of the
same _size_, _shape_, _motion_, _age_, _sap_, _quality_, _power_, or
any other way the _same_, which may also agree, in some one or more
particulars, as to their _Interiour Structure_: and to make this
comparison, throughout all their _Parts_ and _Properties_. To observe
them likewise, in several _Seasons_ of the Year, and in several _Ages_
of the _Plants_, and of their _Parts_; in both which, divers of
them may be noted to change, not only their _Dimensions_, but their
_Natures_ also; as _Vessels_, do into _Ligaments_; and _Cartilages_,
into _Bones_, sometimes, in _Animals_. And to do all this by several
Ways of _Section_, Oblique, Perpendicular, and Transverse; all three
being requisite, if not to Observe, yet the better to Comprehend,
some Things. And it will be convenient sometimes to Break, Tear, or
otherwise Divide, without a _Section_. Together with the _Knife_
it will be necessary to joyn the _Microscope_; and to examine all
the _Parts_, and every Way, in the use of That. As also, that both
Immediate, and Microscopical Inspections, be Compared: since it is
certain, That some things, may be demonstrated by Reason and the Eye
conjunct, without a Glass, which cannot be discovered by it; or else
the discovery is so dark, as which, alone, may not be safely depended
on.

19. §. By these several Ways of Inspection, it will be requisite, To
observe their Compounding _Parts_; as _Simply_ considered, and as
variously _Proportioned_, and _Disposed_. As _Simply_ considered,
to note their _Number_; what, and whether the same, in all: their
_Kinds_, wherein different in the same, or divers _Vegetables_: their
_Original_, in part, or in whole: _Structure_, as to their _Contexture_
and their _Cavities_; Their _Contexture_, within themselves severally,
and as joyned together: their _Cavities_, as to their _Size_, _Shape_,
and _Number_; in which a great variety will be found. Next their
_Positions_ one amongst another, which are also various; as Anterior,
Posterior, Collateral, Surrounding, Mediate, Immediate, Near, Remote;
both as they respect the several _Parts_, and the several portions of
one: And all these, as few, or more; these or others of them, may be
diversely Compounded together. And then the _Proportions_ they bear one
to another; whether as to Minority, Equality, or Excess; each _Part_
compared with each, and that as to the several Degrees appearing in the
said _Proportions_; the Varieties whereof may be exceeding numerous.
For if we should suppose but _Four_ considerable _Parts_ generally
constitutive of a _Vegetable_: These _Four_, produce a Variety _Four_
ways. First, when One is Unequal; and then it produceth only _Four_
Varieties: and those two ways, _scil._ when one is Greater, and the
other three, Equal and Less; or when one is Less; and the other
three, Equal and Greater. Secondly, when Two be Unequal; and then
they produce _Six_ Varieties. Thirdly, when Three be Unequal, which
produceth _Twelve_ Varieties. Or lastly, when all Four be Unequal;
which produceth _Twenty four_: which general Varieties, may be further
multiplied by their several Degrees.

20. §. From all which, we may come to know, what the _Communities_
of _Vegetables_ are, as belonging to all; what their _Distinctions_,
to such a Kind; their _Properties_, to such a Species; and their
_Peculiarities_, to such Particular ones. And as in _Metaphysical_,
or other Contemplative Matters, when we have a distinct knowledge of
the _Communities_ and _Differences_ of Things, we may then be able to
give their true _Definitions_: so may we possibly, here attain, to
do likewise: not only to know, That every _Plant_ Inwardly differs
from another, but also wherein; so as not more surely to Define by
the Outward _Figure_, than by the Inward _Structure_, What that is,
or those things are, whereby any _Plant_, or Sort of _Plants_, may
be distinguished from all others. And having obtained a knowledge
of the _Communities_ and _Differences_ amongst the _Parts_ of
_Vegetables_; it may conduct us through a _Series_ of more facile and
probable _Conclusions_, of the ways of their _Causality_, as to the
_Communities_ and _Differences_ of _Vegetation_. And thus much for the
Second General _Mean_.

21. §. HAVING THUS far examined the _Organical_ and _Containing Parts_
of _Vegetables_; ♦ The Third General _Mean_. ♦ it will be requisite,
more designedly, to observe those also which are _Fluid_, or any others
Contained in them: and that, for our better understanding both of the
_Nature_ of _Vegetation_, and of the said _Contained Parts_. And to
make inquiry, _First_ of their _Kinds_; as _Spirits_; both such as
agree, in general, in being _Vinous_; and those that are Special, to
particular _Plants_. _Aers_ and _Vapours_; for the existence whereof,
in all _Vegetables_, there are Arguments certainly concluding. And for
the difference of their _Natures_, in being more dry, or moist, more
simple or compounded, as they are existent in several _Parts_, there
are probable ones. _Lympha’s_ or clear and watry _Saps_; which most
_Plants_, in one _Part_ or other, at some time of the Year, do _Bleed
Mucilages_; as in _Mallow_ and _Violet Leaves_; in many _Seeds_, as
of _Quinces_, _Clary_; _Fruits_, as in _Cucumers_; distinct from the
watry _Sap_, as by permitting it to stand and gelly upon the _Vessels_
from whence it issues, is plain: And in the young _Berrys_ of White
_Bryony_, when about the bigness of a _Pepper-Corn_; the juyce whereof
is so Viscous, that the twentieth part of a _Grain_, will draw out
above a _Yard_ in length. _Oyles_; not only in _Seeds_, and some
_Fruits_, but other _Parts_; as in certain little cavities in the
_Leaves_ of _Savine_, visibly collected while they are growing. _Gumms_
or _Resines_; as in _Pine_, _Fir_, and others of this Kind. _Milks_;
as in a vast number of _Plants_, and amongst them, many not suspected
to yield any. For, of _Herbs_, not only most of the _Umbelliferous
Kind_, are _Milky_; but all or most of the _Intybous_; _Poppys_;
_Tracheliums_; _Perwinkles_; divers _Thistles_; and even _Onions_,
if cut at the bottome; with a great many more. Of _Trees_, not only
the Little _Maple_, but the young _Shoots_ of _Lawrel_, especially
being crushed; as also those of _Elder_, and some others. To which may
be added, such _Mucilages_, which though not so properly contained
_within_ the _Parts_, yet are found lying _over_ them; as over the
first _Spring-leaves_ of all kinds of _Docks_; betwixt the _Leaves_ and
the _Veil_ wherein they are involved. That fine white Flower or Powder,
which lies over the _Leaves_ of some _Plants_, as of _Bears-Ear_: And
in _Princes-Feather_, about certain _Apertures_ only on the edges of
the _Leaves_.

22. §. Of all these should be observed, _first_ their _Receptacles_;
some of them, being proper to one; others, common to two or more of
them: since it is certain, that some of them do Transmigrate from one,
into another _Receptacle_, or that the same _Receptacle_ is filled with
Fluid Bodies, of a quite different Nature, at the different _Seasons_
of the _Year_, and _Ages_ of the _Vegetable_. And it is also very
probable, That two of some of them, may, sometimes, be contained in one
_Receptacle_, at the same time; as in _Animals_, the _Lympha_ in the D.
_Thoracicus_, and that, and the _Chyle_, in the _Sanguineous Vessels_.

23. §. Then their _Motions_; both _Natural_, and such as may be
effected by _Art_: and those either by Descent or Ascent; And in
ascending, through what different _Chanels_ or _Parts_ of the _Trunk_;
since it is certain, That there is a variety, both in respect of the
_Season_, and of _Vegetables_. Where it will fall in, To observe the
_Tapping_ of _Trees_. As also their _Bleeding_: to what _Trees_ it
is proper to _bleed_: in those to which it is, with what difference
of _Celerity_: and when their peculiar _Season_: for none will bleed
at all times; neither will all _bleed_ at the same. And then their
Collateral _Motion_, together with the Mode of their Transition from
one _Organical Part_ to another.

24. §. Next their _Quantities_, either of _one_; as the Comparison is
made betwixt several _Plants_, or betwixt the _Parts_ of the same. So
the true _Seed_ of all _Plants_, containeth more _Oyl_, in proportion,
than any of the other _Parts_. Or else of _divers_, as coexistent and
bearing such a proportion one to another in the same _Part_: of most
of which, it may be known by their respective _Receptacles_. Yet the
Computation must not be made from the number of the said _Receptacles_,
_simply_; but as that is in conjunction with their _Capacity_; and as
their _Capacity_ is proportioned to their surrounding _Sides_; the
_Sides_ of those of the least _Capacity_, being usually as thick, as
those of the greatest: so that suppose Ten lesser, to lye within the
compass of One greater; the _Content_ of these altogether, would scarce
be equal to half the _Content_ of that One.

25. §. Also their _Consistence_; _scil._: of so many of them as
are discriminable by Touch; in being Soft or Hard; Thin or Thick;
Mucilaginous, Gummous, Glutinous, Friable, _&c._ And these in their
several Degrees; in which there is a Variety, as in the _Milks_ of some
_Plants_, which are more _Dilute_, than that of others: _Mucilages_;
which in some, are very thick and _Viscous_, in others, more diluted
and coming nearer to a _watry Sap_. And by This, to be compared in the
same manner, as by their _Quantity_.

26. §. Likewise their _Colours_, _Smells_, and _Tastes_: The general
and particular Kinds of all which should be noted. And to what
_Contained Parts_, and in what Variety, they appertain. So most
_Resinous Gumms_ are Tinctur’d, some, not; as that which drops from
the _Domestick Pine_, is as clear as Rock-water. The _Milks_ of some
_Plants_ are _Paler_, as in _Burdock_; of others _Whiter_, as in
_Dandelyon_, _Scorzonera_; _Citrine_, in the Root of _Trachelium_,
_Angelica_; _Yellow_, as in _Lovage_. In some _Plants_, _Odorous_,
as in _Umbelliferous_; in others not, as in _Cichoraceous_. That of
Little _Maple_, _Tasteless_; of Garden _Chervil_, _Sweet_; of _Fenil_,
_Hot_; of _Scorzonera_, _Astringent_; of _Dandelion_, _Bitter_; and
generally, in other _Plants_; but with many Degrees of Strength, and
in conjunction with other _Tasts_. But most _Mucilages_, have little
either _Colour_, _Taste_, or _Smell_; and the like. Here also the same
_Qualities_ are to be inquired into, as, in general speaking, they are
said to belong to a _Vegetable_. Since it is more than probable, that
all _Colours_ (excepting _White_, which is sometimes common both to
_Containing_ and _Contained Parts_) all _Odours_, and _Tastes_, which
are more immediately, and without a resolution of their _Essential
Principles_, perceptible in a _Plant_; are not ascribable either to the
_Organical_, or _Containing Parts_; but only to Those, Contained in
them; as from divers reasons hereafter may appear.

27. §. And _first_, their _Colours_; where, with respect to several
_Plants_ and _Parts_, they are more _Changeable_; as Red, in _Flowers_;
or _Constant_, as Green, in _Leaves_. Which, with respect to several
Ages of one _Part_, are more _fading_, as Green in _Fruits_; or
_durable_, as Yellow in _Flowers_. In what _Parts_ more _Single_, as
always in the _Seed_; or more _Compounded_, as in the _Flower_; and in
what _Plants_ more especially, as in _Pancy_. Which proper to _Plants_
that have such a _Taste_ or _Smell_, as both, in _White Flowers_, are
usually less strong. To _Plants_ that flower in such a _Season_, as a
_Yellow Flower_, I think, chiefly, to _Spring Plants_. And to _Plants_
that are natural to such a _Soil_ or _Seat_, as to _Water-plants_, more
usually, a _white Flower_. What, amongst all _Colours_, more Common
to _Plants_, as _Green_; or more Rare, as _Black_. And what all these
Varieties of _Colours_ are upon _Cultivation_, but chiefly, in their
natural _Soil_. To observe also with their superficial _Colours_,
those within: so the _Roots_ of _Docks_, are _Yellow_; of _Bistort_,
_Red_; of _Avens_, Purple; but of most, White. Where the Inward, and
Superficial _Colours_ agree; as in the _Leaves_; or vary, as in the
other Parts frequently. And in what manner they are _Situated_; some
universally spreading, others running only along with the _Vessels_, as
in the _Leaves_ of Red _Dock_, and the _Flowers_ of _Wood-Sorrel_.

28. §. Next their _Odours_; what may be their principal _Seat_; whether
one or divers _Seats_ in the same _Plant_. What the chief _Matter_
out of which they are continually bred. What similitude betwixt the
_Smells_ of divers _Vegetables_; as betwixt _Baume_, and a _Limon_; the
Green _Leaves_ of _Meadow-sweet_, and the green Rinds of _Walnuts_.
Or betwixt those of _Plants_ and _Animals_; as the _Smell_ of green
and well-grown _Carduus_, is like to that rank _scent_, _ab aliquorum
axillis spiranti_. Which have a more sensible _Smell_; as most have;
and which have less, as _Corn_. Where the green _Leaf_ is the most
Fragrant _Part_, as in _Musk-Cranesbill_; where the _Flower_, as in
_Roses_; the _Root_, as in sweet _Calamus_. Where all the _Parts_ have
some _Odour_, where some, or one, only; as in _Scurvy-grass_, only the
_Flowers_, unless the _Leaves_ are bruis’d; and in _Arum_, the _Pestil_
only; for neither the _Leaf_, nor _Root_ hath any _Smell_, unless cut;
but this is strong enough, not much unlike to _Humane Excrements_.

29. §. But especially their _Tastes_, which it much importeth us more
precisely to distinguish; _First_, by their general _Kinds_; for the
number, even of these, may be computed greater than usually it is. I
remember not, that _Heat_ and _Acritude_, with respect to _Taste_, are
distinguished; yet _Arum-Root_ is very _Pungent_, without any proper
_Heat_; and _Cloves_, are very _Hot_, without any proper _Pungency_.
So the White _Roots_ of _Yarrow_, have a _Taste_, hardly any other
way perceptible, than by causing a gentle _glowing_ and _continued
Warmth_ upon the Tongue. Also their _Respondencies_ one to another;
as that of _Zedoary_, and of the lesser _Cardamoms_, is somewhat like
to _Camphire_. Likewise their _Degrees_; in which there is a great
latitude, and may be extended from _One_ to _Ten_, or with easie
distinction, from _One_ to _Five_: So the _Root_ of _Sorrel_, is Bitter
in the _first_; of _Dock_, in the _second_; of _Dog-Rose_, in the
_third_; of _Dandelyon_, in the _fourth_; of _Gentian_, in the _fifth_:
observing them, not only as they vary in several _Kinds_ of _Plants_,
but the several _Species_ of one, as in _Cichory_, _Hawkweed_,
_Dandelyon_. And then their _Compositions_; for _Tastes_ are as truly
_conjunct_ in one _Part_, as _Colours_: by which, the latitude is still
greater; In that all Kinds of _Tastes_, in all their Degrees, and in
differing Numbers, may be variously Compounded together: For the most
part, _Two_, as in the _Leaves_ of _sharp-pointed Dock_, _Astringent_,
and _Sowre_; in _Sorrel-Roots_, _Astringent_ and _Bitter_; and in
_Aloes_, _Bitter_ and _Sweet_; the one in the _fifth_, the other, in
the _first Degree_; as upon an unprejudiced tryal may be perceived:
and yet more evidently in the _Gall_ of any _Land-Animal_. Sometimes
_three_, as in _Agrimony_, _Bitter_, _Rough_, and _Sowrish_ and in
_Agarick_, _Bitter_, _Rough_, and _Sweet_. And sometimes, perhaps
more. The Sensible distinctions of all which, may lye almost as wide,
as of _Plants_ themselves. Wherefore, although it may be thought
rashness, to take away the distinctions of _Hot_, _Cold_, _Moist_,
_Dry_, _Thin_, _Gross_, and other _Qualities_, in their several Degree,
which the _Ancients_ have affixed to particular _Plants_: yet since
they have done it, to many of them, with much uncertainty; and that,
withal, they are, more properly, the _Effects_ and _Operations_ of
_Plants_, than their _Qualites_; Practical Observation, may therefore
approve it useful, to add these Sensible Ones of various _Tastes_,
precisely distinguishing their _Conjugations_ and _Degrees_. Lastly,
their several Varieties and Mutations, with respect to the Subject
wherein they reside, should also be noted. As, of all _Tastes_ found
in _Plants_, _Bitter_ and _Sowr_, are most common; _Sweet_ and _Salt_,
most rare. Which latter, is not only perceptible in some _Sea-Plants_;
but upon some others, as upon the fresh _Leaves_ of _Tamarisk_; which
being licked while they grow, or when immediately gathered, are plainly
_Saltish_. How they vary with the _Age_ of the _Plant_, or _Part_; as
the _Roots_ of _Radishes_, growing up to _Seed_, lose the strength of
their _Tast_; so most _Fruits_ are first _Sowre_, then _Sweet_. What
proper to the several _Parts_ of any one _Plant_; so the _Leaves_ of
_Wormwood_ are extraordinary _Bitter_; the _Root_ scarcely so at all;
of an _Hot_, but quite different _Taste_. What more Common, or Rare, to
any _Part_; so no _Root_ that I ever tasted, is _Sowre_. And how they
Alternate in several _Plants_; as the _Root_ of _Stock-July-flower_
is biting, not the _Leaves_; on the contrary, the _Leaves_ of the
_Water-Arsmart_, are _Biting_; but not the _Root_; and the like.
To which we may add the difference of Time wherein the _Tastes_ of
_Plants_ are perceived; as those of _Arum_, and _Rape-Crowfoot_, are
both _Biting_; but that of the first, as it is slowly perceived, so it
continues long; that of the other, quickly comes, and quickly goes.

30. §. Amongst the other Adjuncts of the _Contained Parts_, though not
of these only, the _Faculties_ of _Vegetables_ are to be reputed. For
so the _Rosin_ of _Jalap_, which is Purgative, is as truly contained
in the _Organical Parts_ of that _Root_, as Blood is in _Veins_: It
will be requisite therefore to make particular observation of these
also. And first, what _Faculties_ chiefly may reside in _Plants_,
above others: so there is none of known use in _Salivation_, except
by holding in the mouth: Although we may ask, Why some amongst them,
may not (being Taken inwardly) have a power to evacuate by This, as
well as other Violent ways? Where the _Faculty_ is more universally
spread over all the _Parts_ of a _Vegetable_, as in _Asarum_. Where
belonging chiefly or wholly to any particular _Parts_ or _Part_; as
chiefly to the _Root_ of _Rhubarb_; and only to the true and proper
_Seed_ of _Barbado Nuts_. Whether some _Faculties_, may be proper
to some _Parts_ especially. What conjunction they may have with any
sensible _Qualities_. So, many _Purgers_, are not only _Resinous_
and _Gummous_; But also _Mucilaginous_; as _Bryony_, wild _Cucumer_,
_Lapathum Sativum_; and therefore probably _Rhubarb_, when growing;
_Mallows_, _Violets_, _&c._ Such as are Purging and Vomitory, though
some of them have a strong _Taste_, yet the greater part, and of those,
many of the stronger sort, have no _Taste_, or not Great; as _Senna_,
_Jalap_, _Scammony_, _Hellebore_, _Asarum_, and others. Amongst which,
although _Hellebore_ hath a very _Durable Taste_, yet is it not very
_High_ or _Great_. So also, those that are most sensibly tasted, are,
I think, for the most part, more or less _Bitter_; either simply, as
_Colocynthis_; or _Bitter_ and _Astringent_, as _Rhubarb_; or _Bitter_
and _Sweet_, as _Aloe_; or _Bitter_, _Astringent_, and _Sweet_, as
_Agarick_. Few are _Hot_, as _Iris_. Or _simply_ Sweet. And though
some may be Subacid, that are Mollifying or Lenitive, yet no proper
Purge or Vomit is _Sowre_. Such _Plants_ as are of a soft and sweetish
_Taste_, without Viscosity, may be accounted good _Antiscorbuticks_,
especially against the _Sea_, or other _Salt-Scurvey_; as are good
sweet Pease: And sometimes the _Water_ or _Spirit_ of the _Shells_;
which may easily be drawn from them, being first duly fermented, and
hath a true _Vinous Taste_; but very mild, and not unpleasant. Those
_Plants_, whose Parts are not only _Hot_ but _Volatile_, as _Onions_,
are generally good for _Burns_. Such as have a _Balsamick Taste_ or
_Smell_, with a little _Astringency_, as _Hypericum_, _Golden-Rod_,
_Lamium Luteum_, _&c._ the best _Wound-Herbs_. And such as are gently
_Bitter_, and _Penetrant_ upon the _Tongue_, or in the _Throat_, as
_Daisy_, _Anagallis_, good _Cleansers_. That such _Bodys_, principally,
are _Anodyne_, which are _Yellow_, I think, is more than a conceit;
Yelks of Eggs, Fœnugreek Seeds, Lint-seed Oyl, May-Butyr, Marrow,
_Pinguedo Humana_, _Hyoscyamus luteus_, Safron, Sulphur, Opium, all
_Anodyne_ and _Yellow_. How likewise their _Faculties_ and _Qualities_
may vary their Degrees, either differently or together: so _Aloe_ and
_Colocynthis_, are both _Bitter_ in the highest Degree; yet _Aloe_,
which is also _Sweet_, Purgeth more moderately; _Colocynthis_, which is
_Bitter_, but not _Sweet_, most Violently. How far the _Faculties_ of
_Vegetables_, as well as their _Qualities_, may be Compounded; where,
and which chiefly; as Astrictive and Purgative in _Rhubarb_. Where
this Question may be put, Whether divers other, and yet more extreme
_Faculties_, as well as these of Astrictive and Purgative, may not
somewhere or other be also found, or made, to meet: whereby the same
_Plant_, or some _Preparation_ of it, may be most Potent, and yet most
Innocent; the _Malignity_ thereof exerting its Power, and the _Virtue_
its Sovereignty at the same time. And lastly, what _Affinity_ there
may be betwixt them; as most _Plants_, that are strong Purgatives,
and especially Vomitories, I think, are also _Sternutatory_; as white
_Hellebore_, _Jalap_, _Tobacco_: and on the contrary, such as are
_Sternutatory_, are some of the most proper and most potent _Medicines_
for the Head, Brain, and _Genus Nervosum_, Taken inwardly, as _Lilium
convalle_, _&c._ and the like.

31. §. Thus far a particular observation of the _Qualities_ and
_Faculties_ of the _Contents_ of _Vegetables_ may proceed, as they are
existent in their _Natural Estate_. From which, although some probable
Conjectures may be made, of their Material and Formal _Essences_,
and of the _Causes_ of their determinate Varieties, or the _Modes_
of _Vegetation_ necessary thereunto: yet will our Conceptions hereof
be more facile, clear, and comprehensive, if by all other Ways of
Observation, they be likewise examined, according as _Experiment_ maybe
applicable to any of them.

32. §. As by _Contusion_; so some _Plants_ give their _Smell_, not
without Rubbing, or not so well; as the green _Leaves_ of _Stramonium_,
_Scurvygrass_, and many more: others lose it by Rubbing, as the
_flowers_ of _Violets_, _Carnations_, _Borage_, _&c._ others yield it
both ways, as _Rosemary_, _&c._ So some _Apples_ mend their _Taste_, by
Scoaping, and _Pears_ by Rowling, especially that called the _Rowling
Pear_.

33. §. By _Agitation_; which doth that, sometimes, by Force, which
_Digestion_, doth by Heat: so any cold _Oyl_ and a _Syrup_ being, in
a due manner, agitated together, of two Fluid bodies will become one
Consistent, as is known.

34. §. By _Frigifaction_; how far the _Juyces_ of _Plants_, either
without or within them, may be any of them, or some more than others,
subject to _Cold_: and thereby to be deprived of their _Motion_ or
natural _Consistence_, or may suffer alteration in their _Colour_,
_Taste_, or _Smell_.

35. §. By _Infusion_; where I mean _Infusion_ only in Common Water; So
both _Cassia Lignea_, and _Cinnamon_ are a little Mucilaginous; but
the former most. Some of the _Contents_ of _Plants_, may be wholly
dissolved in Common Water; some but in part, others not at all; or
very little; which is proper to some _Milks_, as well as _Gums_. The
_Colours_, _Smells_ or _Tastes_ they hereupon yield, are found various;
and in some very unexpected: So the green _Leaves_ of _Bawm_, being
duly infused in common Water, without any other Body added, tincture it
with a clear and deep Red, near that of _Claret Wine_, as I have often
tryed.

36. §. By _Subsiding_; So the Juyce of _Sorrel_, being ordered as that
of _Grapes_, will, in time, let fall a kind of _Tartar_ or _Essential
Salt_. And so perhaps will that of many other _Plants_, without any
previous _Decoction_; although that be commonly thought to be necessary.

37. §. By _Digestion_ with _Fermentation_; either of the entire
_Vegetables_, or of the _Juyces_, or other _Contents_; and these by
themselves, or with common Water. And hereby to note, what difference
may be in the Strength, Celerity, or Continuance of the _Fermentation_.
Likewise, how their _Qualities_ may thereby be altered; as the Smell
of _Violet-flowers_, from a most excellent _Fragrancy_, may, by
_Digestion_, be reduced to an odious and abominable _Stink_, like that
of the black Mud of _Gutters_.

38. §. By _Digestion_ with _Calefaction_; so the _Colour_ of the
_Juyce_ of _Limons_, from Transparency (if that be a Colour) may be
turned to a perfect Red. Whence it is that many are deceived in the
_Preparation_ called the _Tincture_ of _Corals_; supposing the _Corals_
to give the _Menstruum_ its Colour. Whereas the _Menstruum_ will obtain
it, only by _Digestion_, without any _Corals_, mixed with it.

39. §. By _Decoction_; either of _Vegetables_ themselves, or of their
_Liquors_; and to observe what alterations follow. So _Turpentine_
boiled becometh friable, _Sugar_, _Bitter_, and of a Brown Red.
_Turneps_ lose their Biting _Taste_; _Onions_, their Picquancy; yet
neither of them convey those self same _Qualities_ to the Water. The
same may be observed in the _Decoction_ of _Sweet-Fennel-seeds_,
_Aniseeds_, and others, losing much of their _Tastes_ themselves, and
yet conveying very little of them to the _Liquors_ wherein they are
boiled; the greater portion of their Volatile parts, and so their
_Virtue_ and _Taste_ therewith, flying away. Whereof therefore it is
much better to make an _Emulsion_, than to _decoct_ them; or to make
an _Emulsion_ from them, with their own _Decoction_, especially if
the _Medicine_ be intended to be _Carminative_, as I have frequently
observed. The _Decoction_ should also be carried on throughout all
degrees to that of an _Extract_; by which the _Qualities_ thereof,
sometimes, are much altered; as the _Colour_ of all or most green
_Leaves_, from a kind of Yellow, deepens at last into a dark one, as
Black as Pitch.

40. §. By _Distillations_; both with the cold _Still_, _Alembick_,
_Chappel-_ and open _Furnace_: and to note what _Vegetables_ thus give
their _Smell_ or _Taste_, and in what Degrees of strength, either
under, or over their natural ones; as _Mint_, _Pennyroyal_, and the
like, which are _Aromatick_ and _Hot_, give their _Tastes_ perfect: but
_Wormwood_, which is _Aromatick_ and _Bitter_; gives it but by halfs,
pretty fully as _Aromatick_, little as _Bitter_. And _Carduus_, though
also so exceeding _Bitter_, yet not being _Aromatick_, yieldeth a much
weaker _Taste_. Also what _Vegetables_ yield _Oyl_ most plentifully;
and what difference may be in those _Oyls_, as to their _Colour_,
_Weight_, or otherwise; as that of _Cloves_ is sometimes Red; of
_Cinnamon_, limpid; both Ponderous. So to distil _Juices_, _Gums_, or
other _Contents_, with an hot _fire_; and to see, what Bodies they
yield, and of what _Qualities_; as _Turpentine_ is known to yield,
besides its _Oyl_, a subacid _Water_; _Vinegar_, an Eager _Spirit_; as
that part may be called, which _Chymists_ are wont to call the _Phlegm_.

41. §. By _Arefaction_; so _Milks_ which are Liquid, and White in
their Natural Estate, in Standing, grow Gummous, Yellow, and otherwise
different, so doth that of _Scorzonera_; and that of _Fenil_ becomes a
Balsamical, but Limpid _Oyl_. The _Roots_ of _Angelica_, being dry’d,
and cut by the length, exhibit their small _Veins_ fill’d with an
Aromatick _Rosin_. In the whiter parts of _Rhubarb_, is gathered a kind
of _Saline Concret_; by which, this _Root_, in chewing, seems as if it
were a little gritty. _Cabbage-Stalks_, sliced, and laid in the Shade
to dry, gather on them a kind of _Nitrous_ Hoar. _Raisins_ and _Corins_
contain, not only a sweet Juyce, but also a true _Sugar_, which lies
_curdled_ in the _Pulp_, as the more _Saline_ parts do in Green Soap.
And the like is gather’d on the out-side of a _Fig_; saving, that it is
more _Nitrous_, as lying next the _Aer_. The _Roots_ of _Arum_, upon
drying, lose much of the strength of their _Taste_; but the contrary
may be noted of many other _Roots_, which, upon drying, increase it.
Some, being cut and laid by, change their Natural _Colours_, into Red,
Purple, Yellow, Green, or White; as _Liquorish_, into White, in some
places; and _Peony_, into Red: and sometimes into two; as _Patience_,
into Yellow and Red.

42. §. By _Assation_; thus _Apples_, by roasting, eat more Sowre. The
_Root_ of _Horse-Radish_, toasted, tasteth like a _Turnep_. _Potatoes_,
_Onions_, and many other _Roots_, and _Parts_, have their _Tastes_,
either Altered or Refracted; which chiefly, and in what manner, should
be observed. There is one alteration, as remarkable, as commonly known;
and is that which followeth upon roasting or baking in one kind of the
_Waldensian Pears_, which, for a _Walden_, we corruptly call a _Warden_.

43. §. By _Ustion_; wherein some _Plants_, or _Parts_ of them, burn
very quietly; others, not without violent motions; so _Fenil-Seeds_,
held in the flame of a Candle, will spit and spurtle, like the _Serum_
of _Blood_. Some _Vegetables_ lose their _Smell_, as _Roses_; others,
keep it, as _Rosemary_; and others, mend it, as _Lignum Aloes_, To
note, not only the alteration of their _Qualities_, but what they
yield; as _Turpentine_, which, in _Distillation_, yieldeth _Oyl_ and
_Water_, both limpid; upon _Ustion_, sheweth nothing but a black
_Soot_. So _Benzoine_, by _Distillation_, _Oyl_; by _Ustion_, white
_Flowers_, as is known.

44. §. By _Calcination_; and here to observe, wherein the _Caput
Mortuum_ of one, may differ from, or agree in Nature with that of
another; and also to compare these with those of _Animal Bodies_. As
also in their _Quantities_. And to compare them with what they yield by
_Distillation_ and _Ustion_ as to both. Thus far they have been tryed
_singly_, or by themselves. They should also be examined.

45. §. By _Composition_; not only with _Water_, as in simple
_Infusions_, _&c._ but with any other Bodies, which may have a power
of acting upon them, or upon which, these may have a power to act. And
so to make _Infusions_, _Destillations_, _Decoctions_, _Digestions_,
in divers kinds of _Liquors_, as _Vinegar_, _Urine_, _Spirit_ of _H.
H. Wine_, _Blood_, _Milk_, or others. So in _Infusions_, some Red
Colours are heightned by _Acids_; Blews, turned Purple. So fetid
_Spirits_ (as of _H.H._) may be rendred much more grateful, by being
_Rectified_, once or twice, with fresh _Aromaticks_, To observe also
what follows, upon mixing the _Liquors_, or other Parts of _Plants_
together, as _Oyl_ of _Turpentine_, by _Digestion_ with a _Lixivial
Salt_, extracteth thence a Red _Tincture_. Or with _Salts_, _Earths_,
_Metals_, or any other Bodies; as the _Juyce_ of the green _Leaves_ of
_Rasberry_, _Primrose_, and divers other _Plants_ (I think principally
such as are Astringent) expressed upon _Steel_, as it drieth, becometh
of a _Purple Colour_.

46. §. Lastly, by _Compounding_ the _Experiment_ it self, or joyning
two or more of them, upon the same matter: as _Fermentation_ and
_Destillation_, as is used for some _Waters_. _Infusion_ and
_Fermentation_, as in making of _Beer_. _Fermentation_ and _Coction_,
or rather _Assation_, as in making of _Bread_. _Arefaction_ and
_Destillation_, as may be tryed upon some _Herbs_; and with what
difference from what may be noted, upon their being distilled, moist.

47. §. Having proceeded thus far, by all the above particular Ways
of Observation; a Comparative Prospect must be taken of them: by
which, at last, the _Communities_ and _Differences_ of the _Contents_
of _Vegetables_, may be discerned; the manner of their _Causation_
and _Original_, partly, be judged of; and wherein it is, that the
_Essence_ of their several _Natures_ and _Qualities_ doth consist, in
some measure comprehended. And consequently, both from the knowledge
of their particular _Natures_, and the Analogy found betwixt them;
we may be able, better to conjecture, and try, what any of them are,
or may be good for. For certainly, we shall then know, more readily,
to apply things unto, and more fitly to prepare them for, their
Proper Uses, when we first know, _what they are_. Notwithstanding,
since the _Faculties_ of _Plants_, do often lie more recluse; it
is best,therefore, not wholly to acquiesce in such Conjectures, as
their _Tastes_, or other _Sensible Properties_ may suggest; but to
subjoyn _Experiment_. In making of which, and in passing a Judgment
thereupon, many Cautions, both in respect of the _Plant_ whereof, and
the _Subject_ whereupon it is made, are requisite to be attended. Which
yet, in regard they result not so directly from the Matter at present
in hand; I shall not, therefore, here insist upon them, And thus much
for the Third General _Mean_.

48. §. THE _Contents_ of the _Organical Parts_ of _Vegetables_, having
been thus duly Examined: ♦ The Fourth General _Mean_. ♦ it will be
requisite to make the like Inquiry into their _Principles_; or the
_Bodys_, immediately concurrent and essential to their Being. And of
these, we are to observe, First, their _Number_; whether well reducible
to _five_, _six_, _seven_, or _more_, or _fewer_: and the Special
Differences observable under any one General; since there are many
Bodies, of very different Natures, confounded under one Name. Next
their _Conjugation_; which they are, that either under or over those
observable in _animal_, or other _Bodies_, are here joyned together in
a _Plant_; How far common to the _Organical Parts_ of divers _Plants_;
or to the several _Organical Parts_ of one; or how far different in
them. So the predominant _Principle_ of the _Parenchymous Parts_ of a
_Plant_, that it is an _Acid_, seems evident, From the general Nature
of _Fruits_; and of _Corn_; and most _Parenchymous Roots_, which are
either Spirituous, or Sower, or by Digestion, do easily become such.
Likewise their _Proportions_; which stand in the greatest, which
in the least, or in the meaner _Quantities_, and in what Degrees;
both in divers _Vegetables_, and in the several _Organical Parts_ of
one. And then the _Concentration_ and _Union_ of them altogether;
as to the degrees of their Closeness or Laxity; or the manner of
their Implication and Coherency; or as to their Location, one being
more Central, another more Exposed and Rampant over the rest; or
otherwise different. To examine these _Principles_, by their _Colour_,
_Taste_, _Smell_, _Consistence_, _Fixedness_, _Volatility_, _Weight_,
_Figures_, or other _Accidents_. And to these purposes, to go through
the formentioned Ways of _Experiment_; as _Ustion_, _Calcination_,
_Destillation_, _&c._ as any of them may appear applicable hereunto.
So the _Essential Salt_ of _Wormwood_, which may be obtained from the
_Lixivial_; is _Bitter_, transparent, and commonly, of a _Cylindrick_
figure: whereas that which is obtained by _Coction_, or from the
_Extract_, is _tasteless_, greyish, and almost _Cubick_: and that
in the Extract of the Green _Leaves_ of _Violets_, appears in fine
transparent _Shoots_, like so many little Needles. And it is probable,
That the _Salts_ of most Kinds of _Plants_, whether Lixivial or
Essential; and of these, whether obtained by _Decoction_, or otherwise,
have either their _Figure_, or other _Qualities_, proper to themselves,
whereby they are all distinguished one from another. And lastly,
to make _Experiment_ upon these _Principles_, mixing them with one
another, or with other Bodies, or otherwise.

49. §. I know it will be difficult to make observations of this kind
upon the _Organical Parts_ of _Plants_, severally. Yet I have thought
of some Ways, whereby true and undeceivable ones may be made. And the
better to illustrate what I mean, I shall give one or two Instances
of Tryal to this purpose. For the making of which, and some others of
the like nature, I considered, That upon the _Anatomical Analysis_
of all the _Parts_ of a _Plant_, I had certainly found, (and shall
hereafter shew) That in all _Plants_, there are _Two, and only Two
Organical Parts Essentially distinct_, _viz._ The _Pithy Part_, and the
_Lignous Part_, or such others as are analogous to either of These. So
that, if we can think of any _Plants_, which will afford us either of
these two, though not perfectly, yet in some good measure, simple and
unmixed: We may then see, by putting them to a _Chymical Test_, what
_Principles_ and _Proportion_ of _Principles_, concur to _specifie_
their _Substantial Forms_.

50. §. To the _Pithy Part_, _Starch_, or pure _Manchet_ is analogous,
as having very little of the _Lignous_ mixed with them. I therefore
ordered ℔ ij of _Starch_ to be put into a _Retort_, and with a
_Receiver_ affixed, to be set in a _Sand Furnace_; and that all it
would yield, should, by degrees, be forced over; which, besides what
was evaporated at the Neck of the _Receiver_, was about ℔ j. of an acid
and eager _Liquor_, of a heavy and blackish _Oyl_ ℥ ss, and of a light
_Oyl_ ʒ j. The _Caput Mortuum_ could not be reduced to Ashes, by the
strongest heat which a _naked fire_ in that Furnace would produce.

51. §. To the _Lignous Part_, _Hemp_ or _Flax_ is analogous, having
very little of the _Pithy_ mixed with them. I caused therefore ℔ ij
of _Flax_ to be put into a _Retort_, and manag’d as the _Starch_:
whereupon, it yielded a Liquor, as I remember, somewhat like the
former, and about the same quantity; no _Oyl_ which remained liquid,
when cold; but instead of that a _Butyr_, almost of the Consistence and
Colour of the _Oyl_ of _Mace_; and of this above ℥ iij, or near six
times the quantity of the _Oyl_ which was yielded by the _Starch_. The
_Caput Mortuum_ being burned to a white _Ash_, yielded some portion of
a _Lixivial Salt_.

52. §. From whence, I shall, at present, only make these two Remarques;
_First_, That although the chief portion, as to quantity, in both
these _Bodys_, (as in most _Plants_) is an Acid Liquor; yet the
latter, yields also some of an Alkaly, which the other doth not. So
that they are the _Lignous Parts_ of a _Plant_, generally, which
yield the _Alkalick Salt_, or at least in the greatest Proportion.
_Secondly_, That the _Sulphurious or Oleous Principle_, is also much
more predominant in the _Lignous Part_, than in the _Pithy_. To these,
the like Tryals upon other _Plants_, should be added; and other ways.
So, in regard the _Soot_ of most _Woods_, yields a _Volatile Alkaly_;
it were fit to examine, Whether the _Soot_ which is made of the _Pithy
Parts_ and that, of the _Lignous_, afford the said _Alkaly_, in equal
qantity; or whether, as is most likely, that of the _Lignous_ doth
afford it in a far greater: and the like.

53. §. The prosecution of what is here proposed, will be requisite,
To a fuller and clearer view, of the _Modes_ of _Vegetation_, of
the _Sensible Natures_ of _Vegetables_, and of their more Recluse
_Faculties_ and _Powers_. First, of the _Modes_ of _Vegetation_. For
suppose we were speaking of a _Root_; from a due consideration of the
_Properties_ of any _Organical Part_ or _Parts_ thereof; ’tis true,
that the real and genuine _Causes_ may be rendred, of divers other
dependent _Properties_, as spoken generally of the whole _Root_. But
it will be asked again, What may be the _Causes_ of those _first_ and
Independent ones? Which, if we will seek, we must do it by inquiring
also, What are the _Principles_ of those _Organical Parts_? For it is
necessary, that the _Principles_ whereof a Body doth consist, should
be, if not all of them the _active_, yet the _capacitating Causes_, or
such as are called _Causæ sine quibus non_, of its becoming and being,
in all respects, both as to _Substance_ and _Accidents_, what it is:
otherwise, their Existence, in that Body, were altogether superfluous;
since it might have been without them: which is so, it might then
have been made of any other; there being no necessity of putting
any difference, if neither those, whereof it is made, are thought
necessary to its Being. Wherefore if we will allow a Body, and so the
_Organical Parts_ of a _Vegetable_ to have _Principles_, we must allow
these _Principles_ their necessary Use; and that the Shapes or other
Properties of the said _Parts_, are as much dependant upon the _Nature_
of These; as is the Roundness of a Drop of Ink, upon the Fluidity of
Water, ingredient to it.

54. §. Again, the _Principles_ of the _Organical Parts_ being known,
we may from thence obtain a further knowledge of the _Natures_, and
_Causation_ or _Original_ of their _Contents_; since these _Contents_
are not only included in the said _Organical Parts_, but also Created
by them: and must needs be so, whether we will suppose the _Principles_
of these _Contents_ to be præ-existent to their reception thereinto,
or not. For, if not præ-existent, what can be clearer, than that the
said _Parts_ give them their Existence? And if præ-existent, yet in
regard they are distinguished, and such only of them admitted in
such sort into an _Organical Part_, from amongst others, as are apt
to combine and mix together in such a _Form_, and so to constitute
such a _Liquor_; it is as clear, that the Existence, if not of those
_Principles_, yet of that _Liquor_, is dependent on the said _Part_.

55. §. And if by means of the said _Organical Parts_, it is, that their
_Contents_ become _such_ and _such_ peculiar _Mixtures_; it is hence
also manifest, That, by the same means, they are of _such_ distinct
_Faculties_ and _Powers_: Because the _Faculty_ or _Power_ of a Body,
lieth not in any of its _Principles_ apart; but is a Resultance from
them all; or from their being, in such peculiar sort and manner, United
and Combined together. So the _Principles_ of the Purgative Parts of a
_Root_, as of _Rhubarb_, although we should suppose them to be existent
in the surrounding _Earth_, yet we cannot say, That _that Earth_, or
the _Principles_ therein contained, are Purgative; but only that they
are such, as by being combined together, in such a peculiar way, may
become _so_. So the several parts of a _Clock_, although they are and
must be all præ-existent to it, and it is their _Form_, by which they
are, what they are; yet is it the _setting together_ of such _Parts_,
and in such a way only, that makes them a _Clock_. And since we see
that the _Mixture_ of two Bodies of two different _Qualities_, as of
Two _Colours_, will produce a Third _Colour_, differing from them both;
as Blue and Red, do a Murrey: Why should not Two or More Bodies of
different _Natures_, be so combined together, as to produce a Third
_Nature_? Or wherefore may not that be allowed to be performed by
_Nature_, which by Artificial Compounding of _Medicines_, or other
Bodies, is designed, and often times effected? I’ll give but one
Instance; _Water_, _Grease_, and an _Alcatizate Salt_, may be easily so
ordered as to be inverted with new _Qualities_, _Nature_, and _Powers_;
the _Salt_, to lose its extreme fiery Pungent _Taste_; the _Tallow_,
its _Smell_; and being before unsociable with the _Water_, to mingle
therewith: neither _Tallow_, _Salt_, nor _Water_ alone, will fetch out
a spot of _Grease_; but all united easily do it: the same Three Bodys
united, are, in some Cases, as in the _Jaundies_, no ill _Medicine_;
any of which, given alone, may rather prove prejudicial, than a cure:
and all this done, only by duly boiling them together into one Body,
which we call _Sope_.

56. §. Whence again, if it be such an _Union_, and _Proportion_, of
such a _Sort_ of _Principles_, which produceth such a _Faculty_;
and that we may, by any means, come to know what these are; we may,
possibly, also attain to the knowledge of such _Rules_, whereby any
kind of _Faculty_ may be made; as to Compound such Bodies, which are
neither Purgative nor Vomitory, so together, as to be Invested with
those _Faculties_. And if to Make them, then consequently, to Mend,
Exalt, Strengthen, and Enoble them, with greater ease and certainty.
And thus much for the Fourth General _Mean_.

57. §. HITHERTO, We have considered the _Materials_ of a _Vegetable_,
only as Ingredient to it: ♦ The Fifth General _Mean_. ♦ there yet
remains a _Fifth Story_ to be ascended; which is, to consider these
_Materials_ as they are derived from _abroad_: or as, after they are
received and naturalized, they may, with others yet abroad, have any
kind of correspondence. And these are _Four_ in general, _scil._
_Earth_, _Water_, _Aer_, and _Sun_; all which, in that they contribute
so universally to _Vegetation_, and to whatsoever is contained in
a _Vegetable_, it is therefore requisite, that of These likewise,
Particular Observation should be made.

58. §. And First, of the _Earth_, and of all Solid Receptacles of
_Plants_. Where we are to consider their several _Kinds_; as Mellow,
Sandy, Clayie, Chalky, and others. Their _Ingredients_; as Rank and
Mellow _Earth_, with Sand, or with Clay; or Sand with Clay; or
altogether; and in what Proportions. The _Principles_ whereinto any
one of these _Ingredients_, separated from the rest, and put to the
Test of _Distillation_, _Ustion_, _Calcination_, or other, either
alone, or by mixture with other Bodies, may be Resolved. And by their
_Qualities_, as _Colour_, _Smell_, _Taste_, _&c._ both _Ingredients_
and _Principles_ to be examined. To make tryal of the growth of
_Plants_, in all kinds of _simple Soils_; either _Earthy or Mineral_,
as Clay, Marl, Oker, Fullers Earth, Bole Armeniac, Vitriol, Allum,
_&c._ or _Vegetable_, as Rotten Wood, Brans, Starch, or Flower, _&c._
or _Animal_, as Dungs, pounded Flesh, dried and powdered Blood, and the
like; that it may appear, how far any of these may contribute to the
growth of a _Plant_; or to one, above another.

59. §. Next of the _Water_, and of all Liquid Receptacles. Where the
several kinds of _Water_, from Wells, Springs, Rain, and Rivers are,
by their _Qualities_ and _Faculties_, to be examined; as these, and
by these, their _Principles_, either in their Natural State, or upon
Digestion, or otherwise, may be observable: since Common _Water_ it
self, is undoubtedly compounded of several _Principles_; the simplicity
thereof, not being argued, from its Clearness and Transparency; for
a Solution of _Alum_, though it containeth a considerable quantity
of _Earth_, is yet very Clear: nor from its seeming to have neither
_Smell_ nor _Taste_; for _Water-drinkers_ will tell you of the
varieties of both in different _Waters_. Besides, if these _Qualities_
should be accounted rather Phansie, than Sense; the difference of
_Waters_ is yet more manifest, from their different Effects, observed
by _Cooks_, _Laundresses_, _Brewers_, and others, that have occasion
to use them: for not to mix with _Sope_, without curdling; not to boil
Meat tender, or without colouring it red; and the like, are the vices
of some _Waters_, not of others, which yet would seem, in Colour,
Taste, and Smell, to be the same. Tryal should also be made of the
growth of _Plants_ in all kinds of Liquid Receptacles, as _Common
Water_, _Snow Water_, _Sea Water_, _Urine_, _Milk_, _Whey_, _Wine_,
_Oyl_, _Ink_, _&c._ Or any of these, with a solution of _Salt_,
_Nitre_, _Sal prunellæ_, _Sope_, or other body. And hereby to observe
what follows, either in the _Liquor_, or in the _Plant_ it self: as
if any _fixed_ Body, being weighed before its dissolution in _Water_;
and if the _Plant_, set herein, groweth; the _Water_, being then
evaporated; whether the quantity of that dissolved body, continue the
same, or is lessened. So, whether any _Vegetable_ will become _Opiate_,
by growing a considerable time in a plain Solution or Water-tincture
of _Opium_; and the like. Which _Experiments_, what event soever they
have, yet at least, for our further instruction in the _Nature_ of
_Vegetation_, may be of use.

60. §. Next of _Aer_, where it will be requisite to inquire, what
sort of Bodies may be herein contained: It being probable, from the
variety of _Meteors_ formed herein; and of _Vapours_ and _Exhalations_
continually advanced hereinto; that some or other of them, may bear
an Analogy, to all Volatile Bodys, whether _Animal_, _Vegetable_, or
_Mineral_. The flourishings also of _Frozen Dew_; and the Green Colour,
which the _Aer_ gives the Ground or Water, when, for some time exposed
to it; and other effects; seem to argue, that it is Impregnated with
_Vegetable Principles_. To consider also the peculiar Nature of that
Body, which is strictly called, _Aer_, And of that true _Aerial Salt_,
which to me, seemeth probable, that it is dissolved in the _Æther_, as
other _Salts_ are in _Water_, or in the Vaporous parts of the _Aer_. As
also to try, what different Effects, a diversity of _Aer_ may have upon
a _Vegetable_; as by setting a _Plant_, or _Seed_, either exceeding
Low, as at the bottom of a deep Well; or exceeding High, as on the top
of a Steeple. Or else by exposing some _Soil_ to the _Aer_, which is
assuredly free from any _Seed_, and so, as no _Seed_ can light upon
it; and to observe, whether the _Aer_ hath a power of producing a
_Vegetable_ therein, or not: and the like.

61. §. Lastly of the _Sun_; as to which, it may be considered, What
Influence it may have upon the _Plant_ it self; upon the _Soil_; Or
upon the _Aer_. Whether that _Influence_ is any thing else besides
Heat: or may differ from that of a _Fire_, otherwise, than by being
Temperate, and more Equal. That it doth, seems evident from an
_Experiment_ sometime since given us, in one of the _Parisian Journals
des Scavans_, and which I therefore think very applicable to our
present purpose. If you hold a _Concave_ at a due distance, against a
Fire, it will collect and cast the Heat into a burning _Focus_: but if
you put a piece of plain Glass between them, the Glass will scatter the
Heat, and destroy the _Focus_. Whereas the _Sun-Beams_, being gathered
in like manner, will pass through the interposed Glass, and maintain
their _Focus_. As for That, of the Collection of the _Sun-beams_, by
the help of _Glasses_, in the form of a _Magistery_, or of _Flowers_,
and such like, I desire to suspend my thoughts of them, till I see
them. I will only say thus much further at present, That I do not
understand why the _Sun_ should not have some Influence upon Bodies,
besides by Heat, if it may be granted, That the _Moon_ hath; for which,
it should seem, there are some good Arguments.

62. §. WE HAVE thus far examined the _Principles_ necessary to
_Vegetation_. ♦ A Sixth General _Mean_. Only hinted. ♦ The _Question_
may be put once more, In what manner are these _Principles_ so adapted,
as to become capable of being assembled together, in such a _Number_,
_Conjugation_, _Proportion_, and _Union_, as to make a _Vegetable
Body_? For the comprehension whereof, we must also know, What are
the _Principles_ of these _Principles_. Which, although they lie in
so great an abyss of obscurity; yet, I think, I have some reason to
believe, that they are not altogether undiscoverable. How far they may
be so, I am so far from Determining, that I shall not now Conjecture.


♦ The Conclusion. ♦ 63. §. THIS is the _Design_, and these the _Means_
I propose in order thereunto. To which, I suppose, they may all appear
to be necessary. For what we obtain of _Nature_, we must not do it by
commanding, but by courting of Her. Those that woo Her, may possibly
have her for their Wife; but She is not so common, as to prostitute her
self to the best behaved _Wit_, which only practiseth upon it self,
and is not applied to her. I mean, that where ever Men will go beyond
Phansie and Imagination, depending upon the Conduct of _Divine Wisdom_,
they must Labour, Hope and Persevere. And as the _Means_ propounded,
are all necessary, so they may, in some measure, prove effectual.
How far, I promise not; the Way is long and dark: and as Travellers
sometimes amongst Mountains, by gaining the top of one, are so far from
their Journeys end; that they only come to see another lies before
them: so the Way of _Nature_, is so impervious, and, as I may say,
down Hill and up Hill, that how far soever we go, yet the surmounting
of one difficulty, is wont still to give us the prospect of another.
We may therefore believe, our attainments will be imperfect, after
we have done all: but because we cannot attain to all, that therefore
we should endeavour after nothing; is an Inference, which looks so
much awry from the Practical Sense of Men, that it ought not to be
answered. Nor with better Reason, may we go about determining, what
may be done. The greatest Designs that any Men undertake, are of the
greatest uncertainty, as to their Success: which if they appear to be
of good Import, though we know not how far they are attainable, we are
to propound the _Means_, in the utmost use whereof only, we can be able
to judge: A _War_ is not to be quitted, for the hazards which attend
it; nor the _Councils_ of _Princes_ broken up, because those that sit
at them, have not the Spirit of Prophecy, as well as of Wisdom. To
conclude, If but little should be effected, yet to design more, can do
us no harm: For although a Man shall never be able to hit _Stars_ by
shooting at them; yet he shall come much nearer to them, than another
that throws at _Apples_.

                                CHESTER.

     _MY LORD_,

I Hope your pardon, if while you are holding _That best of Books_
in one Hand, I here present some Pages of that of _Nature_ into
your other: Especially since _Your Lordship_ knoweth very well, how
excellent a _Commentary_ This is on the _Former_; by which, in part,
_GOD_ reads the World his own Definition, and their Duty to him.

But if this Address, _my Lord_, may be thought congruous, ’tis yet
more just; and that I should let _Your Lordship_, and others know,
how much, and how deservedly, I resent _Your_ extraordinary Favours.
Particularly, that you were pleased, so far to animate my Endeavours,
towards the Publishing the following _Observations_. Many whereof,
and most belonging to the _First Chapter_, having now lain dormant,
near seven years; and might still, perhaps, have so continued, had not
_Your Lordships_ Eye, at length, created Light upon them. In doing
which, _You_ have given one, amongst those many Tokens, of as well
_Your_ readiness to promote Learning and Knowledge by the hands of
others; as _Your_ high Abilities to do it by _Your_ Own: Both which,
are so manifest in _Your Lordship_, that, like the first Principles of
_Mathematical Science_, they are not so much to be asserted, because
known and granted by all.

The Consideration whereof, _my Lord_, may make me not only _Just_, in
owning of your Favours; but also most _Ambitious_ of your _Patronage_:
Which yet, to bespeak, I must confess, I cannot well. Not that I think,
what is Good and Valuable, is always its own best Advocate: for I know,
that the Censures of Men, are humorous, and variable; and that one
_Age_, must have leave to frown on those _Books_, which another, will
do nothing less than kiss and embrace. But, chiefly, for this Reason,
Lest I should so much as seem desirous, of _Your Lordships_ Solliciting
my Cause, as to all I have said. For as it is your Glory, that you like
not so to shine, as to put out the least Star; so were it to _Your_
Dishonour, to borrow _Your_ Name, to illustrate the Spots, though of
the most conspicuous. I am,

                                _My Lord,

                             Your Lordships

                              Most Obliged,

                                   And

                          Most Humble Servant_

                                 PLANTS,

                                 BEGUN.

                 With a General Account of _Vegetation_,
                           Founded thereupon.




                                CHAP. I.

                _Of the Seed in its State of Vegetation._


BEING to speak of _Plants_; and, as far as Inspection, and consequent
Reason, may conduct, to enquire into the visible _Constitutions_,
and _Uses_ of their several _Parts_: I choose that Method, which, to
the best advantage, may suit with what we have to say hereon. And
that is the Method of Nature her self, in her continued Series of
_Vegetations_; proceeding from the _Seed sown_, to the formation of the
_Root_, _Trunk_, _Branch_, _Leaf_, _Flower_, _Fruit_, and last of all,
of the _Seed_ also to be _sown again_; all which, we shall, in the same
order, particularly speak of.

2. §. The _Essential Constitutions_ of the said _Parts_ are in all
_Plants_ the same: But for Observation, some are more convenient; in
which I shall chiefly instance. And first of all, for the _Seed_, we
choose the great _Garden-Bean_.

3. §. If then we take a _Bean_ and dissect it, we shall find it
cloathed with a doubled _Vest_ or _Coat_. These _Coats_, while the
_Bean_ is yet green, are separable, and easily distinguished. Or in an
old one, after it hath lay’n two or three days in a mellow Soil; or
been soaked as long a time in Water: as in _Tab. 1_. ♦ _Tab. 1. f. 2._
♦ When ’tis dry, they cleave so closely together, that the Eye not
before instructed, will judge them but one; the inner _Coat_ (which is
of the most rare contexture) so far shrinking up, as to seem only the
roughness of the outer, somewhat resembling _Wafers_ under _Maquaroons_.

4. §. The Inner _Coat_, in its Natural State, is every where twice, and
in some places, thrice as thick, as the Outer. Next to the _Radicle_,
which I shall presently describe, it is six or seven times thicker; and
encompasses the _Radicle_ round about, as in the same _Figure_ appears.
♦ _Tab. 1. f. 2._ ♦

5. §. At the thicker end of the _Bean_, in the outer _Coat_, a very
small _Foramen_ presents it self, even to the bare Eye. In Dissection
’tis found to terminate against the point of that _Part_ which I
call the _Radicle_. ♦ _Tab. 1. f. 1–2._ ♦ It is of that capacity,
as to admit a small _Virginal_ Wyer; and is most of all conspicuous
in a green _Bean_. Especially, if a little magnified with a good
_Spectacle-Glass_. This _Foramen_ is not a hole casually made, or
by the breaking off of the Stalk; but designedly formed, for the
uses hereafter mentioned. It may be observed not only in the great
_Garden-Bean_, but likewise in the other _kinds_; in the _French-Bean_
very plainly; in _Pease_, _Lupines_, _Vetches_, _Lentiles_, and other
_Pulse_ ’tis also found; and in many _Seeds_ not reckoned of this
kindred, as in that of _Fœnugreek_, _Medica Tornata_, _Goats-Rue_, and
others: In many of which, ’tis so very small, as scarcely, without the
help of _Glasses_ to be discovered; and in some, not without cutting
off part of the _Seed_, which otherwise would intercept the light
hereof.

6. §. That this _Foramen_ is truly permeable, even in old
_Setting-Beans_, and the other _Seeds_ above named, appears upon their
being soaked for some time in Water. For then, taking them out, and
crushing them a little, many small bubles will alternately arise and
break upon it.

7. §. Of all _Seeds_ which have thick or hard _Covers_, it is also
observable, That they have the same likewise _Perforated_, as above
said, or in some other manner. And accordingly, although the _Coats_ of
such _Seeds_ as are lodg’d in _Shells_ or _Stones_, being thin, are not
visibly _perforated_; yet the _Stones_ and _Shells_ themselves always
are; as in _Chap. 7._ shall be seen how. To which _Chapter_, what is
farther observable, either as to the nature and number of the _Covers_
of the _Seed_, I also refer.

8. §. The _Coats_ of the _Bean_ being stripp’d off, the proper _Seed_
shews it self; The parts whereof it is composed, are three; _sc._ the
_Main Body_, and two more, appendant to it; which we may call the Three
_Organical Parts_ of the _Bean_.

9. §. The _Main Body_ is not one entire piece, but always divided,
lengthwise, into two halves or _Lobes_, which are both joyn’d together
at the _Basis_ of the _Bean_. These _Lobes_ in dry _Beans_, are but
difficultly separated or observ’d; ♦ _Tab. 1. f. 2, 3._ ♦ but in young
ones, especially boil’d, they easily slip asunder.

10. §. Some very few _Seeds_ are divided, not into two _Lobes_, but
into more; as that of _Cresses_ into Six. ♦ _Tab. 1. f. 4. f. 5._ ♦
And some are not at all divided, but entire; as the Grains of _Corn_.
Excepting which few, all other _Seeds_, even the smallest, are divided,
like as the _Bean_, into just two _Lobes_. Whereof, though in most
_Seeds_, because of their minuteness, we cannot by dissection be
inform’d; yet otherwise, we easily may, as in this _Chapter_ shall be
seen.

11. §. At the _Basis_ of the _Bean_, the two other _Organical Parts_
stand appendent; by mediation whereof, the two _Lobes_ meet and join
together. The greater of these two _Parts_ stands without the two
_Lobes_, and upon divesting the _Bean_ of its _Coats_, is immediately
visible. ♦ _Tab. 1. f. 2. & 3_ a ♦ ’Tis of a white colour, and more
glossie than the _Main Body_, especially when the _Bean_ is young. In
the _Bean_, and many other _Seeds_, ’tis situated somewhat above the
thicker end, as you hold the _Bean_ in its most proper posture for
growth. In _Oak-Kernels_, which we call _Acorns_, _Apple-Kernels_,
_Almonds_, and many other _Seeds_, it stands prominent just from the
end; ♦ _Tab. 1. f. 6_ c. ♦ the _Basis_ and the _End_ being in these the
same, but in the _Bean_ divers.

12 §. This _Part_ is found not only in the _Bean_, and the _Seeds_
above mentioned; but in all others: being that, which upon the
Vegetation of the _Seed_, becomes the _Root_ of the _Plant_; which
therefore may be called the _Radicle_: by which, I mean the Materials,
abating the Formality, of a _Root_. In _Corn_, it is that _Part_, which
_Malsters_, upon its shooting forth, call the _Come_. ’Tis not easie
to be observed, saving in some few _Seeds_, amongst which, that of the
_Bean_ is the most fair and ample of all I have seen. But that of some
other _Seeds_, is, in proportion, greater; ♦ _Tab. 1. f. 7_ e. ♦ as of
_Fœnugreek_, which is full as big as one of its _Lobes_.

13. §. The lesser of the two said Appendents lies occult between the
two _Lobes_ of the _Bean_, by separation whereof only it is to be seen.
’Tis enclos’d in two small _Cavities_, form’d in the _Lobes_ for its
reception. ♦ _Tab. 1. f. 3_ b. ♦ Its colour comes near to that of the
_Radicle_; and it is founded upon the _Basis_ thereof, having a quite
contrary production, _sc._ towards the _Cone_ of the _Bean_; as being
that very _Part_, which, in process, becomes the _Body_ or _Trunk_, of
the _Plant_. In _Corn_, it is that _Part_, which after the _Radicle_
is sprouted forth, or _come_, shoots towards the smaller end of the
_Grain_; and by many _Malsters_, is called the _Acrospire_.

14. §. This _Part_ is not, like the _Radicle_, an entire Body, but
divided, at its loose end, into divers pieces, all very closely couched
together, as Feathers in a Bunch; for which reason it may be called
the _Plume_. They are so close, that only two or three of the outmost
are at first seen: but upon a nice and curious separation of these,
the more interiour still may be discovered. In the _Bean_, this may be
done: but in very few other _Seeds_; because of the extreme smallness
of the _Plume_. Now as the _Plume_ is that _Part_ which becomes the
_Trunk_ of the _Plant_, so these pieces are so many true, and already
formed, though not display’d _Leaves_, intended for the said _Trunk_,
and foulded up in the same _plicature_, wherein upon the sprouting of
the _Bean_, they afterwards appear. In a _French Bean_, and especially
in the larger white Kind, or in the great _Indian Phaseolus_, the two
outmost are very fair and elegant. ♦ _Tab. 1. f. 8_ b. ♦ In the great
_Garden-Bean_ two extraordinary small _Plumes_ often, if not always,
stand one on either side the great one now describ’d: From which, in
that they differ in nothing save in their size, I therefore only here
just take notice of them. And these three Parts, _sc._ the _Main Body_,
the _Radicle_, and the _Plume_, are concurrent to the making up of a
_Seed_; and no more than these.

15. §. Having thus taken a view of the _Organical Parts_ of the _Bean_,
and other _Seeds_; let us next examine the _Similary_, _sc._ those
whereof the _Organical_ are compos’d: a distinct observation of which,
for a clear understanding of the _Vegetation_ of the _Seed_, and of the
whole _Plant_ arising thence is requisite: To obtain which, we must
proceed in our _Anatomy_.

16. §. Dissecting a _Bean_ then, the first _Part_ occurring is its
_Cuticle_. The Eye and first Thoughts, suggest it to be only a more
dense and glossy Superficies; but better enquiry discovers it a real
_Cuticle_. ’Tis so exquisitely thin, and for the most part, so firmly
continuous with the Body of the _Bean_, that it cannot, except in some
small Rag, be distinctly seen, which, by carrying your Knife aslant
into the _Bean_, and then very gently bearing upward what you have cut,
will separate, and shew it self transparent. This _Cuticle_ is not only
spread upon the _Convex_ of the _Lobes_, but also on their _Flats_,
where they are contiguous, extending it self likewise upon both the
_Radicle_ and _Plume_, and so over the whole _Bean_.

17. §. This _Part_, though it be so far common with the _Coats_ of
the _Bean_, as to be like those, an _Integument_; yet are we in a
quite different Notion to conceive of it: For whereas the _Coats_,
upon setting the _Bean_, do only administer the _Sap_, and, as being
superseded from their Office, then die; as shall be seen: this, on
the contrary, with the _Organical Parts_ of the _Bean_, is nourished,
augmented, and by a real _Vegetation_ co-extended.

18. §. Next to the _Cuticle_, we come to the _Parenchyma_ it self;
the _Part_ throughout which _the Inner Body_, whereof we shall speak
anon, is disseminated; for which reason I call it the _Parenchyma_.
Not that we are so meanly to conceive of it, as if (according to the
stricter sense of that word,) it were a meer concreted Juyce. For it is
a Body very curiously _organiz’d_, consisting of an infinite number of
extreme small _Bladders_; as in _Tab. 1._ is apparent. ♦ _Tab. 1. f.
9._ ♦ The _Surface_ hereof is somewhat dense, but inwardly, ’tis of a
laxer Contexture. If you view it in a _Microscope_, or with a very good
_Spectacle-Glass_, it hath some similitude to the _Pith_, while _sappy_
in the _Roots_ and _Trunks_ of _Plants_; and that for good reason, as
in _Ch. 2._ shall be seen. This is best seen in green _Beans_.

19. §. This _Part_ would seem by its colour to be peculiar to the
_Lobes_ of the _Bean_; but as is the _Cuticle_, so is this also,
common both to the _Radicle_ and _Plume_; that is, the _Parenchyma_ or
Pulp of the _Bean_, as to its essential substance, is the same in all
three. The reason why the colour of the _Plume_, and especially of the
_Radicle_, which are white, is so different from that of the _Lobes_,
which are green, may chiefly depend upon their being more compact and
dense, and thence their different Tinctures. And therefore the _Lobes_
themselves, which are green while the _Bean_ is _young_; yet when it is
_old_ and _dry_, become whitish too. And in _many_ other _Seeds_, as
_Acorns_, _Almonds_, the _Kernels_ of _Apples_, _Plums_, _Nuts_, _&c._
the _Lobes_, even _fresh_ and _young_, are pure white as the _Radicle_
it self.

20. §. But although the _Parenchyma_ be common, as is said, to all the
_Organical Parts_; yet in very differing proportions. In the _Plume_,
where it is proportionably least, it maketh about three _Fifths_ of the
whole _Plume_; in the _Radicle_, it maketh above five Sevenths of the
whole _Radicle_; and in each _Lobe_, is so far over-proportionate, as
to make at least nine Tenths of the whole _Lobe_.

21. §. By what hath been said, that the _Parenchyma_ or _Pulp_ is not
the only constituting _Part_, besides the _Cuticle_, is imply’d: there
being another _Body_, of an essentially different substance, embosom’d
herein: which may be found not only in the _Radicle_ and _Plume_, but
also in the _Lobes_ themselves, and so in the whole _Bean_.

22. §. This _Inner Body_ appears very plain and conspicuous in cutting
the _Radicle_ athwart, and so proceeding by degrees towards the
_Plume_, through both which it runneth in a large and strait _Trunk_.
♦ _Tab. 1. f. 10, 11, & 12._ ♦ In the _Lobes_, being it is there in so
very small proportion, ’tis difficultly seen, especially towards their
_Verges_. Yet if with a sharp Knife you smoothly cut the _Lobes_ of
the _Bean_ athwart, divers small _Specks_, ♦ _Tab. 1. f. 13._ ♦ of a
different colour from that of the _Parenchyma_, standing therein all
along in a Line, may be observ’d; which _Specks_ are the Terminations
of the _Branches_ of this _Inner Body_.

23. §. For this _Inner body_, as it is existent in every _Organical
Part_ of the _Bean_; so is it, with respect to each _Part_, most
regularly distributed. In a good part of the _Radicle_ ’tis one entire
_Trunk_; towards the _Basis_ thereof, ’tis divided into three main
_Branches_; ♦ _Tab. 1. f. 14._ ♦ the middlemost runneth directly into
the _Plume_; the other two on either side of it, after a little space,
pass into the _Lobes_; where the said _Branches_ dividing themselves
into other smaller; and those into more, and smaller again, are
terminated towards the Verges of each _Lobe_; in which manner the said
_Inner Body_ being distributed it becomes in each _Lobe_ a true and
perfect _Root_.

24. §. Of this _Seminal Root_, as now we’ll call it, from the
Description here given, it is further observable; That the two main
_Branches_ hereof; in which the several _Ramifications_ in each _Lobe_
are all united, are not committed into the _Seminal Trunk_ of the
_Plume_, nor yet stand at right angles with _That_ and the _Radicle_,
and so with equal respect towards them both: but being produced through
part of the _Parenchyma_ of the _Radicle_, are at last united therein
to the main _Trunk_, and make acute Angles therewith: as may be seen in
the same. _f. 14._ ♦ _Tab. 1. f. 14._ ♦

25. §. This _Seminal Root_ being so tender, cannot be perfectly
excarnated, (as may the _Vessels_ in the _Parts_ of an _Animal_) by the
most accurate Hand. Yet by dissection begun and continu’d, as is above
declared, its whole frame and distribution may be easily observ’d.
Again, if you take the _Lobe_ of a _Bean_, and lengthwise pare off its
_Parenchyma_ by degrees, and in extreme thin slices, many _Branches_
of the _Seminal Root_, (which by the other way of Dissection were only
noted by so many _Specks_) both as they are fewer about the Basis
of the _Bean_, and more numerous towards its Verges, in some good
distinction and entireness will appear. For this you must have new
_Beans_: or else soaked in Water, or buryed for some time.

26. §. As the _Inner Body_ is branched out in the _Lobes_, so is it in
the _Plume_: For if you cut the _Plume_ athwart, and from the _Basis_
proceed along the Body thereof, you’ll therein find, first, one large
_Trunk_ or _Branch_, and after four or five very small _Specks_ round
about it, which are the terminations of so many lesser _Branches_
therewith distributed to the several parts of the _Plume_. ♦ _Tab. 1.
f. 11_ c. ♦ The distribution of the _Inner Body_, as it is continuous
throughout all the _Organical Parts_ of the _Bean_, is represented,
_Tab. 1. f. 14._

27. §. This _Inner Body_ is, by dissection, best observable in the
_Bean_ and great _Lupine_. In other larger _Pulse_ it shews likewise
some obscure Marks of it self. But in no other _Seeds_, which I have
observed, though of the greatest size: as of _Apples_, _Plums_,
_Nuts_, &c. is there any clear appearance hereof, upon dissection,
saving in the _Radicle_ and _Plume_; the reason of which is partly
from its being, in most _Seeds_, so extraordinary little; partly
from its Colour, which in most _Seeds_, is the same with that of the
_Parenchyma_ it self, and so not distinguishable from it.

28. §. Yet in a _Gourd-Seed_, the whole _Seminal Root_, not only its
_Main Branches_, ♦ _Tab. 1. f. 15._ c. ♦ but also the Sub-divisions and
_Inosculations_ of the lesser ones, are without any dissection, upon
the separation of the _Lobes_, on their contiguous Flats immediately
apparent.

And as to the existence of this _Seminal Root_, what Dissection cannot
attain, yet an ocular inspection in hundreds of other _Seeds_, even the
smallest, will demonstrate; as in this _Chapter_ shall be seen how.

29. §. In the mean time, let us only take notice; That when we say,
every _Plant_ hath its _Root_, we reckon short. For every _Plant_
hath really two, though not contemporary, yet successive _Roots_; its
_Original_ or _Seminal-Root_ within the _Lobes_ or _Main Body_ of its
_Seed_; and its _Plant-Root_, which the _Radicle_ becometh in its
growth: the _Parenchyma_ of the _Seed_, being in some resemblance, that
to the _Seminal Root_ at first, which the Mould is to the _Plant-Root_
afterwards; and the _Seminal Root_ being that to the _Plant-Root_,
which the _Plant-Root_ is to the _Trunk_. For our better understanding
whereof, having taken a view of the several _Parts_ of a _Bean_, as
far as Dissection conducts; we will next briefly enquire into the
Use of the said _Parts_, and in what manner they are the Fountain of
_Vegetation_, and concurrent to the being of the future _Plant_.

♦ An Account of the _Vegetation_ of the _Seed_. ♦ 30. §. THE GENERAL
Cause of the growth of a _Bean_, or other _Seed_, is _Fermentation_.
That is, the _Bean_ lying in the Mould, and a moderate access of some
moisture, partly dissimilar, and partly congenerous, being made, a
gentle _Fermentation_ thence ariseth. By which, the _Bean_ swelling,
and the _Sap_ still encreasing, and the _Bean_ continuing still to
swell, the work thus proceeds: as is the usual way of explicating.
But that there is simply a _Fermentation_, and so a sufficient supply
of _Sap_ is not enough: but that this _Fermentation_, and the _Sap_
wherein ’tis made, should be under a various Government, by divers
_Parts_ thereto subservient, is also requisite; and as the various
preparation of the _Aliment_ in an _Animal_, equally necessary:
the particular process of the Work according whereto, we find none
undertaking to declare.

31. §. Let us look upon a _Bean_ then, as a piece of Work so fram’d and
set together, as to declare a Design for the production of a _Plant_;
which, upon its lying in some convenient Soil, is thus effected. First
of all, the _Bean_ being enfoulded round in its _Coats_, the _Sap_
wherewith it is fed, must of necessity pass through these: By which
means, it is not only in a proportionate quantity, and by degrees;
but also in a purer body; and possibly not without some _Vegetable
Tincture_, transmitted to the _Bean_. Whereas, were the _Bean_ naked,
the _Sap_ must needs be, as over-copious, so but crude and immature,
as not being _filtred_ through so fine a _Cotton_ as the _Coats_ be.
And as they have the use of a _Filtre_ to the transient _Sap_; so of
a _Vessel_ to that which is still deposited within them; being alike
accommodated to the securer _Fermentation_ hereof, as Bottles or
Barrels are to Beer, or any other _Fermentative Liquor_.

32. §. And as the _Fermentation_ is promoted by some _Aperture_ in the
Vessel; so have we the _Foramen_ in the upper _Coat_ also contrived.
That if there should be need of some more _Aiery_ Particles to excite
the _Fermentation_; through _this_, they may obtain their Entry. Or,
on the contrary, should there be any such _Particles_ or _Steams_, as
might damp the genuine proceeding thereof, through this again, they may
have easie issue. Or if, by being over copious, they should become too
high a _Ferment_; and so precipitate those soft and slow degrees, as
are necessary to a due _Vegetation_. The said _Aperture_ being that, as
a common Pasport, here to the _Sap_, which what we call the _Bung-hole_
of the Barrel, is to the new tunn’d Liquor.

33. §. And the _Radicle_ being designed to shoot forth first, as
presently shall be shew’d how; therefore is it distinctly surrounded
with the Inner and more succulent _Coat_. That being thereby suppled on
every side, its eruption may be the better promoted.

34. §. The _Sap_ being passed through the _Coats_, it next enters
the Body of the _Bean_; yet not indiscriminately neither; but, being
filtred through the _Outer Coat_, and fermented in the Body of the
_Inner_, is by mediation of the _Cuticle_, again more finely filtr’d,
and so entereth the _Parenchyma_ it self under a fourth Government.

35. §. Through which _Part_ the _Sap_ passing towards the _Seminal
Root_, as through that which is of a more spatious content; besides
the benefit it hath of a farther _percolation_, it will also find room
enough for a more free and active fermenting and _maturation_ herein.
And being moreover, part of the true Body of the _Bean_, and so with
its proper _Seminalities_ or _Tinctures_ copiously repleat; the _Sap_
will not only find _room_, but also _matter_ enough, by whose Energy
its _Fermentation_ will still be more advanced.

36. §. And the _Sap_ being duly prepared here, it next passeth into all
the _Branches_ of the _Seminal Root_, and so under a fifth Government.
Wherein how delicate ’tis now become, we may conceive by the proportion
betwixt the _Parenchyma_ and this _Seminal Root_; so much only of the
best digested _Sap_ being discharged from the whole Stock in that,
as this will receive. And this, moreover, as the _Parenchyma_, with
its proper _Seminalities_ being endowed; the _Sap_ for the supply of
the _Radicle_, and of the young _Root_ from thence, is duly prepared
therein, and with its highest _Tincture_ and _Impregnation_ at last
enriched.

37. §. The _Sap_ being thus prepared in the _Lobes_ of the _Bean_,
’tis thence discharg’d; and either into the _Plume_, or the _Radicle_,
must forthwith issue. And since the _Plume_ is a dependent on the
_Radicle_; the _Sap_ therefore ought first to be dispenced to this:
which accordingly, is ever found to shoot forth before the _Plume_: and
sometimes an inch or two in length. Now because the primitive course
of the _Sap_ into the _Radicle_, is thus requisite; therefore, by the
frame of the _Parts_ of the _Bean_ is it also made necessary. The two
main _Branches_ of the _Seminal Root_, being produced, as is before
observed, not into the _Plume_, but the _Radicle_. Now the _Sap_ being
brought as far as the _Seminal Root_, in either _Lobe_; and according
to the conduct thereof continuing still to move: it must needs
immediately issue into the same _Part_, ♦ _Tab. 1. f. 14._ ♦ whereinto
the main _Branches_ themselves do; that is, into the _Radicle_. By
which _Sap_, thus bringing the several _Tinctures_ of the _Parts_
aforesaid with it, being now fed; it is no longer a meer _Radicle_, but
is made also _Seminal_, and so becomes a perfect _Root_.

38. §. The _Plume_, all this while, lyes close and still. For the sake
of which, chiefly it is, that the _Bean_ and other _Seeds_ are divided
into _Lobes_, _viz._ That it might be warmly and safely lodged up
between them, and so secur’d from the Injuries so tender a _Part_ would
sustain from the Mould; whereto, had the _Main Body_ been entire, it
must, upon the cleaving of the _Coats_, have lay’n contiguous.

39. §. But the _Radicle_ being thus impregnated and shot into a _Root_;
’tis now time for the _Plume_ to rouze out of its Cloysters, and
germinate too: In order whereto, ’tis now fed from the _Root_, with
laudable and sufficient _Aliment_. For as the Supplies and Motion of
_Sap_ were first made from the _Lobes_, towards the _Root_: so the
_Root_ being well shot into the Mould, and now receiving a new and more
copious _Sap_ from thence; the motion hereof must needs be stronger,
and by degrees proceed in a contrary course, _sc._ from the _Root_
toward the _Plume_: and, by the continuation of the _Seminal Root_, is
directly conducted thereinto; by which being fed, it gradually enlarges
and displays it self.

40. §. The course of the _Sap_ thus turned, it issues, I say, in a
direct Line from the _Root_ into the _Plume_: but collaterally, into
the _Lobes_ also; _sc._ by those two aforesaid _Branches_ which are
obliquely transmitted from the _Radicle_ into either _Lobe_. By which
_Branches_ the said _Sap_ being disbursed back into all the _Seminal
Root_, and from thence, likewise into the _Parenchyma_ of the _Lobes_,
they are both thus fed, and for some time augmenting themselves, really
grow: as in _Lupines_ is evident.

41. §. Yet is not this common to all _Seeds_. Some rot underground; as
_Corn_; being of a laxer and less Oleous Substance, differing herein
from most other _Seeds_; and being not divided into _Lobes_, but one
entire thick Body. And some, although they continue firm, and are
divided into _Lobes_, yet rise not; as the great _Garden Bean_. In
which, therefore, it is observable, That the two Main _Branches_ of
the _Lobes_, in comparison with that which runs into the _Plume_, are
but mean; ♦ _Tab. 1. f. 14._ ♦ and so insufficient to the feeding and
vegetation of the _Lobes_; the _Plume_, on the contrary, growing so
lusty, as to mount up without them.

42. §. Excepting a few of these Two Kinds, all other _Seeds_
whatsoever, (which I have observed) besides that they continue firm;
upon the _Vegetation_ of the _Plume_, do mount also upwards, and
advance above the Ground together with it; as all _Seeds_ which spring
up with one or more _Dissimilar Leaves_: These _Dissimilar Leaves_,
for the most part _Two_, which first spring up, and are of a different
shape from those that follow, being the very _Lobes_ of the _Seed_,
divided, expanded, and thus advanced.

43. §. The Impediments of our apprehension hereof are the Colour, Size
and Shape of the _Dissimilar Leaves_. Notwithstanding, that they are
nothing else but the _Main Body_ of the _Seed_, how I came first to
conceive, and afterwards to know it, was thus. First, I observed in
general, that the _Dissimilar Leaves_, were never jagg’d, but even
edg’d: And seeing the even verges of the _Lobes_ of the _Seed_ hereto
respondent, I was apt to think, that those which were so like, might
prove the same. Next descending to particular _Seeds_, I observed,
first, of the _Lupine_; that, as to its Colour, advancing above the
Ground, (as it useth to do) it was always changed into a perfect Green.
And why might not the same by parity of Reason be inferred of other
_Seeds_? That, as to its size, it grew but little bigger than when
first set. Whence, as I discern’d (the Augmentation being but little)
we here had only the two _Lobes_: ♦ _Tab. 2. f. 1._ ♦ So, (as some
augmentation there was) I inferr’d the like might be, and that, in
farther degrees, in other _Seeds_.

44. §. Next of the _Cucumber-Seed_, That, as to its Colour, often
appearing above ground, in its primitive white, from white it turns
to yellow, and from yellow to green; the proper colour of a _Leaf_.
That, as to its size, though at its first arise, the _Lobes_ were
little bigger than upon setting; yet afterwards, as they chang’d their
Colour, ♦ _Tab. 2. f. 2._ ♦ so their dimensions also, growing to a
three-four-five-fold amplitude above their primitive size. But whereas
the _Lobes_ of the _Seed_, are in proportion, narrow, short and thick:
how then come the _Dissimilar Leaves_, to be so exceeding broad, or
long, and thin? The Question answers it self: For the _Dissimilar
Leaves_, for that very reason are so thin, because so very broad or
long; as we see many things, how much they are extended in length
or breadth, so much they lose in depth, or grow more thin; which is
that which here befalls the now effoliated _Lobes_. For being once
dis-imprisoned from their _Coats_, and the course of the _Sap_ into
them, now more and more encreased; they must needs very considerably
amplifie themselves: and from the manner wherein the _Seminal Root_ is
branched in them, that amplification cannot be in thickness, but in
length or breadth. In both which, in some _Dissimilar Leaves_, ’tis
very remarkable; ♦ _Tab. 2. f. 3._ ♦ especially in length, as in those
of _Lettice_, _Thorn-Apple_, and others; whose _Seeds_, although very
small, yet the _Lobes_ of those _Seeds_ growing up into _Dissimilar
Leaves_, are extended an Inch, and sometimes more, in length.
Though he that shall attempt to get a clear sight of the _Lobes_ of
_Thorn-Apple_, and some others, by _Dissection_, will find it no easie
Task; yet is that which may be obtained; and in the Last _Book_ shall
be shew’d. From all which, and the observation of other _Seeds_, I
at last found, that the _Dissimilar Leaves_ of a young _Plant_, are
nothing else but the _Lobes_ or _Main Body_ of its _Seed_. So that,
as the _Lobes_ did at first feed and impregnate the _Radicle_ into a
_perfect Root_; so the _Root_, being perfected, doth again feed, and by
degrees amplifie each _Lobe_ into a perfect _Leaf_.

45. §. The Original of the _Dissimilar Leaves_ thus known, we
understand, why some _Plants_ have none; because the _Seed_ either
riseth not, as _Garden-Beans_, _Corn_, &c. Or upon rising, the _Lobes_
are little alter’d, as _Lupines_, _Pease_, &c. Why, though the proper
_Leaves_ are often indented round; the _Dissimilar_ like the _Lobes_
are even-edg’d. Why, though the proper _Leaves_ are often hairy, yet
these are ever smooth. Why some have more _Dissimilar Leaves_ than
two, as _Cresses_, which have six, as the Ingenious Mr. _Sharrock_
also observes. ♦ Hist. of the _Prop._ of _Vege._ ♦ The reason whereof
is, because the _Main Body_ is not divided into Two, but Six, distinct
_Lobes_, as I have often counted. Why _Radishes_ seem at first to have
four, which yet after appear plainly two: because the _Lobes_ of the
_Seed_, have both a little Indenture, and are both plaited, one over
the other. To which, other Instances might be added.

46. The use of the _Dissimilar Leaves_ is, first, for the protection
of the _Plume_; which being but young, and so but soft and tender, is
provided with these, as a double Guard, one on either side of it. For
this reason it is, that the _Plume_, in _Corn_, is trussed up within a
membranous _Sheath_: and that of a _Bean_, cooped up betwixt a pair of
_Surfoyls_: ♦ _Tab. 3._ ♦ But where the _Lobes_ rise, there the _Plume_
hath neither of them, being both needless.

47. §. Again, since the _Plume_, being yet tender, may be injur’d not
only by the _Aer_, but also for want of _Sap_, the supplies from the
_Root_ being yet but slow and sparing; that the said _Plume_ therefore,
by the _Dissimilar Leaves_, may have the advantage likewise of some
refreshment from Dew or Rain. For these having their _Basis_ a little
beneath that of the _Plume_, and expanding themselves on all sides of
it, they often stand after Rain, like a Vessel of Water, continually
soaking and suppling it, lest its new access into the _Ayr_, should
shrivel it.

48. §. Moreover, that since the _Dissimilar Leaves_ by their _Basis_
intercept the _Root_ and _Plume_, the greater and grosser part of the
_Sap_, may be, by the way, deposited into those; and so the purest
proceed into the yet but young and delicate _Plume_, as its fittest
_Aliment_.

49. §. Lastly, we have here a demonstration of the being of the
_Seminal Root_: which, since through the colour or smalness of the
_Seed_, it could not by Dissection be observ’d, except in some few;
Nature hath here provided us a way of viewing it in the now effoliated
_Lobes_, not of one or two _Seeds_, but of hundreds; the _Seminal
Root_ visibly branching it self towards the Cone or Verges of the said
_Lobes_, or now _Dissimilar Leaves_.




                                CHAP. II.

                             _Of the ROOT._


HAVING Examin’d and pursu’d the Degrees of _Vegetation_ in the _Seed_,
we find its two _Lobes_ have here their utmost period: and, that having
conveyed their _Seminalities_ into the _Radicle_ and _Plume_; these
therefore, as the _Root_ and _Trunk_ of the _Plant_, still survive.
Of these, in their order, we next proceed to speak; and first, of the
_Root_: whereof, as well as of the _Seed_, we must by Dissection inform
our selves.

2. §. In Dissection of a _Root_ then, we shall find it with the
_Radicle_, as the _Parts_ of an Old Man with those of a _Fœtus_,
substantially, one. The first _Part_ occurring is its _Skin_, the
Original whereof is from the _Seed_: For that extreme thin _Cuticle_
which is spread over the _Lobes_ of the _Seed_, and from thence over
the _Radicle_, upon the shooting of the _Radicle_ into a _Root_, is
co-extended, and becomes its _Skin_.

3. §. The next _Part_ is the _Cortical Body_. Which, when it is thin,
is commonly called the _Barque_. The Original hereof, likewise is from
the _Seed_; or the _Parenchyma_, which is there common both to the
_Lobes_ and _Radicle_, being by _Vegetation_ augmented and prolonged
into the _Root_, the same becomes the _Parenchyma_ of the _Barque_. ♦
_Tab. 2. f. 4._ ♦

4. §. The Contexture of this _Parenchyma_ may be well illustrated by
that of a _Sponge_, being a Body Porous, Dilative and Pliable. Its
_Pores_, as they are innumerable, so, extream small. These _Pores_
are not only susceptive of so much Moisture as to fill, but also to
enlarge themselves, and so to dilate the _Cortical Body_ wherein they
are: which by the shriv’ling in thereof, upon its being expos’d to the
Air, is also seen. In which dilatation, many of its Parts becoming
more lax and distant, and none of them suffering a solution of their
continuity; ’tis a Body also sufficiently pliable; that is to say, a
_most exquisitely fine-wrought Sponge_.

5. §. The Extention of these _Pores_ is much alike by the length and
breadth of the _Root_; which from the shrinking up of the _Cortical
Body_, in a piece of a cut _Root_, by the same dimensions, is argu’d.

6. §. The proportions of this _Cortical Body_ are various: If thin,
’tis, as is said, called a _Barque_; and thought to serve to no other
end, than what is vulgarly ascrib’d to a _Barque_; which is a narrow
conceit. If a Bulky Body, in comparison with That within it, as in
the young _Roots_ of _Cichory_, _Asparagus_, &c. ’tis here, because
the fairest, therefore taken for the prime _Part_; which, though, as
to Medicinal use, it is; yet, as to the private use of the _Plant_,
not so. The Colour hereof, though it be originally white, yet in the
continued growth of the _Root_, divers _Tinctures_, as yellow in
_Dock_, _red_ in _Bistort_, are thereinto introduced.

7. §. Next within this Part stands the _Lignous Body_: This _Lignous
Body_, lyeth with all its parts, so far as they are visible, in a
Circle or _Ring_. ♦ _Tab. 2. f. 4._ b. ♦ Yet are there divers extreme
small _Fibres_ thereto parallel, usually mixed with the _Cortical
Body_; and by the somewhat different colour of the said _Cortical Body_
where they stand, may be noted. These _Fibres_ the _Cortical Body_,
and _Skin_, altogether, properly make the _Barque_. The Original of
this _Lignous Body_, as of the two former, is from the _Seed_; or, the
_Seminal Roots_ of both the _Lobes_, being united in the _Radicle_,
and with its _Parenchyma_ co-extended, is here in the _Root_ of the
_Plant_, the _Lignous Body_.

8. §. The Contexture hereof, in many of its parts, is much more
close than that of the _Cortical_; and their _Pores_ very different.
For whereas those of the _Cortical_ are infinitely numerous, these
of the _Lignous_ are in comparison nothing so. But these, although
fewer, yet are they, many of them, more open, fair and visible: as
in a very thin Slice cut athwart the young _Root_ of a _Tree_, and
held up against the light, is apparent. Yet not in all equally; in
_Coran_-Tree, _Goosberry_-Tree, _&c._ less, in _Oak_, _Plums_, and
especially _Damascens_, more; ♦ _Tab. 2. f. 5._ ♦ in _Elder_, _Vines_,
_&c._ most conspicuous. And as they are different in number and size,
so also (whereon the numerousness of the _Pores_ of the _Cortical
Body_ principally depends) in their shape. For whereas those of the
_Cortical Body_ are extended much alike both by the length and breadth
of the _Root_; these of the _Lignous_, are only by the length; which
especially in _Vines_, and some other _Roots_ is evident. Of these
_Pores_, ’tis also observable, that although in all places of the
_Root_ they are visible, yet most fair and open about the _filamentous
Extremities_ of some _Roots_, ♦ _Tab. 2. f. 7._ a. b. ♦ where about,
the _Roots_ have no _Pith_; as in _Fenil_. And in many _Roots_, higher.

9. §. The proportion betwixt this _Lignous Body_ and the _Cortical_,
is various, as was said; yet in this, constant, _sc._ that in the
_filamentous_ and smaller Parts of the _Root_, the _Lignous Body_ is
very much the less; running like a slender _Wyer_ or _Nerve_ through
the other surrounding it. Whereas in the upper part, it is often times
of far greater quantity than the _Cortical_, although it be encompass’d
by it. They stand both together pyramidally, which is most common to
_Infant Roots_, but also to a great many others.

10. §. The next _Part_ observable in the _Root_, is the _Insertment_.
The existence hereof, so far as we can yet observe, is sometimes in
the _Radicle_ of the _Seed_ it self; I cannot say always. As to its
substantial nature, we are more certain; that it is the same with that
of the _Parenchyma_ of the _Radicle_; being always at least augmented,
and so, in part, originated from the _Cortical Body_, and so, at second
hand, from the said _Parenchyma_. For in dissecting a _Root_, I find,
that the _Cortical Body_ doth not only environ the _Lignous_, but is
also wedg’d, and in many Pieces _inserted_ into it; and that the said
inserted Pieces make not a meer Indenture, but transmit and shoot
themselves quite through as far as the _Pith_: ♦ _Tab. 2. f. 5._ ♦
which in a thin Slice cut athwart the _Root_, as so many lines drawn
from the Circumference towards the Center, shew themselves.

11. §. The _Pores_ of the _Insertment_ are sometimes, at least,
extended somewhat more by the breadth of the _Root_, as about the top
of the _Root_ of _Borage_ may be seen; and are thus different from
those of the _Cortical Body_, which are extended by the length and
breadth much alike; and from those of the _Lignous_, being only by its
length.

12. §. The number and size of these Insertions are various. In
_Hawthorn_, and some others, and especially _Willows_, they are most
extream small; in _Cherries_ and _Plums_ they are Biger; ♦ _Tab. 2.
f. 5. & 6._ ♦ and in the _Vine_ and some other _Trees_, very fairly
apparent. In the _Roots_ of most _Herbs_ they are generally more easily
discoverable; which may lead to the observation of them in all.

13. §. These _Insertions_, although they are continuous through both
the length and breadth of the _Root_; yet not so in all Parts, but
by the several shootings of the _Lignous Body_ they are frequently
intercepted. For of the _Lignous Body_ it is (here best) observable;
That its several _Shootings_, betwixt which the _Cortical_ is inserted,
are not, throughout the _Root_, wholly distinct, strait and parallel;
but that all along being enarch’d, the _Lignous Body_, both in length
and breadth, is thus disposed into _Braces_ or _Osculations_. Betwixt
these several _Shootings_ of the _Lignous Body_ thus osculated, the
_Cortical_ shooting, ♦ _Tab. 2. f. 8._ ♦ and being also osculated
answerably _Brace_ for _Brace_, that which I call the _Insertment_ is
framed thereof.

14. §. These _Osculations_ are so made, that the _Pores_ or _Fibres_ of
the _Lignous Body_, I think, notwithstanding, seldom or never run one
into another; being, though contiguous, yet still distinct. In the same
manner as some of the _Nerves_, though they meet, and for some space
are associated together, yet ’tis most probable, that none of their
_Fibres_ are truly inosculated, saving perhaps, in the _Plexures_.

15. §. These _Osculations_ of the _Lignous Body_, and so the
interception of the _Insertions_ of the _Cortical_, are not to be
observ’d by the traverse cut of the _Root_, but by taking off the
_Barque_. In the _Roots_ of _Trees_, they are generally obscure; but in
_Herbs_ often more distinctly apparent; and especially in a _Turnep_:
the appearance whereof, the _Barque_ being stripp’d off, is as a piece
of close-wrought Net-work, fill’d up with the _Insertions_ from thence.

16. §. The next and last distinct _Part_ of the _Root_ is the _Pith_.
The substantial nature thereof, is, as was said of the _Insertment_,
the same likewise with that of the _Parenchyma_ of the _Seed_. And
according to the best observation I have yet made, ’tis sometimes
existent in its _Radicle_; in which, the two main _Branches_ of the
_Lobes_ both meeting, and being osculated together, are thus dispos’d
into one round and tubular _Trunk_, and so environing part of the
_Parenchyma_, make thereof a _Pith_; as in either the _Radicle_, or the
young _Root_ of the great _Bean_ or _Lupine_, may, I think, be well
seen.

17. §. But many times the Original hereof is immediately from the
_Barque_. For in dissection of divers _Roots_, both of _Trees_ and
_Herbs_, as of _Barberry_ or _Mallows_, it is observable, That the
_Cortical Body_ and _Pith_, are both of them participant of the
same Colour; in the _Barberry_, both of them tinged yellow, and in
_Mallows_, green. In cutting the smaller Parts of the _Roots_ of many
_Plants_, as of _Borage_, _Mallows_, _Parsley_, _Columbine_, _&c._
’tis also evident, That the _Lignous Body_ is not there, in the least
Concave, but standeth Solid, or without any _Pith_, ♦ _Tab. 2. f.
9._ a. ♦ in the Center; and that the _Insertions_ being gradually
multiplied afterwards, the _Pith_, at length, towards the thicker parts
of the _Root_, shews and enlarges it self. Whence it appears, that
in all such _Roots_, the _Pith_ is not only of the same substantial
nature, and by the _Insertions_ doth communicate with the _Barque_;
and that it is also augmented by it; which is true of the _Pith_ of
all _Roots_; but is moreover, by mediation of the said _Insertions_,
wholly originated from it; that is to say, from the _Parenchymous_ Part
thereof. The various appearances of the _Insertions_ and _Pith_ from
the filamentous _Parts_ to the top of the _Root_, see in _Tab. 2_.
♦ _Tab. 2. f. 9._ ♦ The _Pores_ of the _Lignous Body_, as it stands
entire in the said filamentous _Parts_, are best seen when they have
lain by a night to dry, after cutting.

18. §. A farther evidence hereof are the Proportions betwixt the
_Cortical Body_ and _Pith_. For as about the inferiour Parts of
the _Root_, where the _Pith_ is small, the _Cortical Body_ is
proportionably great; so about the top, where the _Pith_ is enlarged,
the _Cortical Body_ (now more properly becoming a _Barque_) groweth
proportionably less, _sc._ because the _Insertions_ do still more and
more enlarge the _Pith_. Likewise the peculiar frame of some _Roots_,
wherein besides the _Pith_, the _Lignous Body_ being divided into two
or more _Rings_, there are also one or more thick _Rings_, of a white
and soft substance, which stand betwixt them; and are nothing else
but the _Insertions_ of the _Cortical Body_ collected into the said
_Rings_; but, towards the top of the _Root_, being inserted again,
thus make a large and ample _Pith_; ♦ _Tab. 2. f. 8._ ♦ as in older
_Fennel_-Roots, those of _Beet_, _Turnep_, and some other _Herbs_, is
seen.

19. §. The _Pores_ of the _Pith_, as those of the _Cortical Body_, are
extended both by the breadth and length of the _Root_, much alike; yet
are they more or less of a greater size than those of the _Cortical
Body_.

20. §. The Proportions of the _Pith_, are various; in _Trees_, but
small; in _Herbs_, generally, very fair; in some making by far the
greatest part of the _Root_; as in a _Turnep_: By reason of the wide
circumference whereof, and so the finer Concoction and Assimilation
of its Sap; that _Part_ which in most old _Trunks_ is a dry and harsh
_Pith_, here proves a tender, pleasant meat.

21. §. In the _Roots_ of very many _Plants_, as _Turneps_, _Carrots_,
_&c._ the _Lignous Body_, besides its main utmost _Ring_, hath divers
of its _osculated Fibres_ dispersed throughout the Body of the _Pith_;
sometimes all alike, and sometimes more especially in, or near, its
Center; which _Fibres_, as they run towards the top of the _Root_,
still declining the Center, at last collaterally strike into its
Circumference; either all of them, or some few, keeping the Center
still. Of these principally, the Succulent part of the _Lignous Body_
of the _Trunk_ is often originated.

22. §. Some of these _Pith-Fibres_, although they are so exceeding
slender, yet in some _Roots_, as in that of _Flower de liz_, they
are visibly concave, each of them, in their several Cavities also
embosoming a very small _Pith_; the sight whereof, the _Root_ being cut
traverse, and laid in a Window for a day or two to dry, may without
_Glasses_ be obtain’d. And this is the general account of the _Root_;
the declaration of the manner of its growth, with the use and service
of its several _Parts_, we shall next endeavour.

♦ An Account of the Growth of the _Root_. ♦ 23. §. I SAY THEN, That the
_Radicle_ being impregnate, and shot into the Moulds, the contiguous
moisture, by the _Cortical Body_, being a Body laxe and Spongy, is
easily admitted: Yet not all indiscriminately, but that which is more
adapted to pass through the surrounding _Cuticle_. Which transient
_Sap_, though it thus becomes fine, yet is not simple; but a mixture
of _Particles_, both in respect of those originally in the _Root_, and
amongst themselves, somewhat heterogeneous. And being lodg’d in the
_Cortical Body_ moderately laxe, and of a Circular form; the effect
will be an easie Fermentation. The _Sap_ fermenting, a separation of
_Parts_ will follow; some whereof will be impacted to the Circumference
of the _Cortical Body_, whence the _Cuticle_ becomes a _Skin_; as we
see in the growing of the Coats of Cheeses, of the Skin over divers
Liquors, and the like. Whereupon the _Sap_ passing into the _Cortical
Body_, through this, as through a _Manica Hippocratis_, is still more
finely filtred. With which _Sap_, the _Cortical Body_ being dilated as
far as its _Tone_, without a solution of Continuity, will bear; and
the supply of the _Sap_ still renew’d: the purest part, as most apt
and ready, recedes, with its due _Tinctures_, from the said _Cortical
Body_, to all the parts of the _Lignous_; both those mixed with the
_Barque_, and those lying within it. Which _Lignous Body_ likewise
super-inducing its own proper _Tinctures_ into the said _Sap_; ’tis now
to its highest preparation wrought up, and becomes (as they speak of
that of an Animal) the Vegetative _Ros_ or _Cambium_: the noblest part
whereof is at last coagulated in, and assimilated to the like substance
with the said _Lignous Body_. The remainder, though not united to
it, yet tinctur’d therein, thus retreats, that is, by the continual
appulse of the _Sap_, is in part carried off into the _Cortical Body_
back again, the _Sap_ whereof it now tinctures into good _Aliment_.
So that whereas before, the _Cortical Body_ was only relaxed in its
Parts, and so dilated; ’tis now increas’d in real quantity or number
of parts, and so is truly nourish’d. And the _Cortical Body_ being
saturate with so much of this Vital _Sap_ as serves it self; and
the second Remainders discharged thence to the _Skin_; this also is
nourish’d and augmented therewith. So that as in an _Animal Body_ there
is no instauration or growth of Parts made by the _Bloud_ only, but
the _Nervous Spirit_ is also thereunto assistant; so is it here: the
_Sap_ prepared in the _Cortical Body_, is as the _Bloud_, and that part
thereof prepared by the _Lignous_, is as the _Nervous Spirit_; which
partly becoming Nutriment to it self, and partly being discharged back
into the _Cortical Body_, and diffusing its Tincture through the _Sap_
there, that to the said _Cortical Body_ and _Skin_, becomes also true
Nutriment, and so they all now grow.

24. §. In which growth, a proportion in length and breadth is
requisite: which being rated by the benefit of the _Plant_, both for
firm standing and sufficient _Sap_, must therefore principally be in
length. And because it is thus requisite, therefore by the constitution
of one of its _Parts_, _sc._ the _Lignous Body_, it is also made
necessary. For the _Pores_ hereof, in that they are all extended by
its length, the _Sap_ also according to the frame and site of the said
_Pores_ will principally move; and that way as its _Sap_ moves, the
same way will the generation of its Parts also proceed; _sc._ by its
length. And the _Lignous Body_ first (that is by a _priority causal_)
moving in length it self; the _Cortical_ also moves therewith. For that
which is nourish’d, is extended: but whatever is extended, is mov’d:
that therefore which is nourish’d, is mov’d: The _Lignous Body_ then
being first nourish’d, ’tis likewise first mov’d, and so becomes and
carries in it the Principle of all Vegetative motion in the _Cortical_;
and so they both move in length.

25. §. Yet as the _Lignous Body_ is the _Principle_ of Motion in
the _Cortical_; so the _Cortical_ is the _Moderator_ of that in the
_Lignous_: As in Animal Motions, the _Principle_ is from the _Nerves_;
yet being once given to the _Muscle_ or _Limb_, and that moving
proportionably to its structure, the _Nerves_ also are carried in the
same motion with it. We suppose therefore, that as the principal motion
of the _Lignous Body_ is in length, so is its _proper tendency_ also
to _Ascend_. But being much exceeded both in Compass and Quantity by
the _Cortical_, as in the smaller parts of the _Root_ it is; it must
needs therefore be over-born and governed by it; and so, though not
lose its motion, yet make it that way wherein the _Cortical Body_ may
be more obedient to it; which will be by descent. Yet both of them
being sufficiently pliable, they are thus capable, where the Soyl may
oppose a direct descent, there to divert any way, where it is more
penetrable, and so to descend obliquely. For the same reason it may
also be, that though you set a _Bean_ with the _Radicle_ upward; yet
the _Radicle_, as it shoots, declining also gradually, is thus arch’d
in form of an Hook, and so at last descends. For every declination from
a perpendicular Line, is a mixed motion betwixt Ascent and Descent, as
that of the _Radicle_ also is, and so seeming to be dependent upon the
two _Contrary Tendencies_ of the _Lignous_ and _Cortical Bodies_. What
may be the cause of those _Tendencies_ (being most probably external,
and a kind of _Magnetisme_) I shall not make my Task here to enquire.

26. §. Now although the _Lignous Body_, by the position and shape
of its _Pores_, principally groweth in length; yet will it in some
degree likewise in breadth: For it cannot be supposed that the purest
_Sap_ is all received into the said _Pores_; but that part thereof
likewise, staying about its _Superficial Parts_, is there tinctur’d
and agglutinated to them. And because these _Pores_ are prolonged by
its length; therefore it is much more laxe and easily divisible that
way; as in slitting a Stick, or cleaving of Timber, and in cutting and
hewing them athwart is also seen. Whence it comes to pass, that in
shooting from the Center towards the Circumference, and there finding
more room, its said original _Laxity_ doth easily in divers places now
become greater, and at length in open _Partments_ plainly visible.
Betwixt which _Partments_, the _Cortical Body_, being bound in on the
one hand, by the surrounding _Skin_ and _Moulds_, and pressed upon by
the _Lignous_ on the other, must needs insert it self, and so move
contrary to it, from the Circumference _towards_ the _Center_. Where
the said contrary motions continued as begun, they at last meet, unite,
and either make or augment the _Pith_. And thus the _Root_ is fram’d,
and the _Skin_, the _Cortical_ and _Lignous Bodies_, so as is said,
thereunto concurrent. We shall next shew the use of the two other
_Parts_, _sc._ the _Insertment_ and _Pith_; and first of the _Pith_.

27. §. ONE true use of the _Pith_ is for the better Advancement of
the _Sap_, whereof I shall speak in the next Chapter. The use I here
observe, is for the quicker and higher Fermentation of the _Sap_:
For although the Fermentation made in the _Cortical Body_ was well
subservient to the first _Vegetations_, yet those more perfect ones in
the _Trunk_ which after follow, require a Body more adapted to it, and
that is the _Pith_; which is so necessary, as not to be only common
to, but considerably large in the _Roots_ of most _Plants_; if not in
their inferiour parts, yet at their tops. Where though either deriv’d
or amplify’d from the _Cortical Body_, yet being by its _Insertions_
only, we may therefore suppose, as those, so this, to be more finely
constituted. And being also from its coarctation, while inserted, now
free; all its _Pores_, upon the supply of the _Sap_, will more or less
be amplified: Upon which accounts, the _Sap_ thereinto received, will
be more pure, and its fermentation therein more active. And as the
_Pith_ is superiour to the _Cortical Body_ by its _Constitution_, so
by its _Place_. For as it thus stands central, it hath the _Lignous
Body_ surrounding it. Now as the _Skin_ is the Fence of the _Cortical
Body_, and that of the _Lignous_; so is the _Lignous_ again a far more
preheminent one unto the _Pith_; the _Sap_ being here a brisk Liquor,
_tunn’d up_ as in a wooden _Cask_.

28. §. And as the _Pith_ subserves the higher Fermentation of the
_Sap_; so do the _Insertions_ its purer Distribution; that separation
which the parts of the _Sap_, by being fermented in the _Pith_, were
dispos’d for; being, upon its entrance into the _Insertions_, now
made: So that as the _Skin_ is a _Filtre_ to the _Cortical Body_, so
are the _Insertions_ a more preheminent one to the _Lignous_. And as
they subserve the purer, so the freer and sufficient distribution of
the _Sap_: For the _Root_ enlarging, and so the _Lignous Body_ growing
thicker, although the _Cortical_ and the _Pith_ might supply _Sap_
sufficient to the nutrition of its _Parts_ next adjacent to them; yet
those more inward, must needs be scanted of their _Aliment_; and so,
if not quite starved, yet be uncapable of equal growth: Whereas the
_Lignous Body_ being through its whole breadth frequently disparted,
and the _Cortical Body_ inserted through it; the _Sap_ by those
_Insertions_, as the _Bloud_ by the disseminations of the _Arteries_,
is freely and sufficiently convey’d to its intimate Parts, even those,
which from either the _Barque_ or from the _Pith_, are most remote.
Lastly, as the consequent hereof, they are thus assistant to the
_Latitudinal growth_ of the _Root_; as the _Lignous Body_ to its growth
in Length; so these _Insertions_ of the _Cortical_, to its better
growth in Breadth.

29. §. Having thus seen the solitary uses of the Several _Parts_ of the
_Root_, I shall lastly propound my Conjectures of that Design whereto
they are altogether concurrent, and that is the _Circulation_ of the
_Sap_.

30. §. That the _Sap_ hath a Double, and so a _Circular_ Motion, in the
_Root_; is probable, from the proper Motion of the _Root_, and from its
Office. From its Motion, which is Descent: for which, the _Sap_ must
likewise, some where, have such a Motion proper to it. From its Office,
which is, To feed the _Trunk_: for which, the _Sap_ must also, in some
_Part_ or other, have a more especial Motion of Ascent.

31. §. We may therefore suppose, That the _Sap_ moving in the _Barque_,
towards the _Pith_, through the _Insertions_, thereinto obtains a
pass, Which passage, the upper _Insertions_ will not favour; because
the _Pith_ standing in the same height with them, is there large,
the fermenting and course of the _Sap_ quick, and so its opposition
strong. But through the lower it will much more easily enter; because
there, from the smallness of the _Pith_, the opposition is little, and
from the shortness of the _Insertions_, the way more open. So that
the _Sap_ here meeting with the least opposition, here it will bestow
it self (feeding the _Lignous Body_ in its passage) into the _Pith_.
Into which, fresh _Sap_ still entring, this being yet but crude, will
subside: that first receiv’d, and so become a Liquor higher wrought,
will more easily mount upwards. And moving in the _Pith_, especially
in the _Sap-Fibers_ there dispers’d, as in the _Arterys_, in equal
altitude with the upper-_Insertions_; the most volatile parts of all
will still continue their direct ascent towards the _Trunk_. But those
of a middle nature, and, as not apt to ascend, so being lighter than
those beneath them, not to descend neither; they will tend from the
_Pith_ towards the _Insertions_ in a Motion betwixt both. Through which
_Insertions_ (feeding the _Lignous Body_ in its passage) it is, by the
next subsequent _Sap_, discharged off into the _Cortical Body_, and
so into the _Sap-Fibres_ themselves, as into the _Veins_, back again.
Wherein, being still pursu’d by fresh _Sap_ from the Center, and more
occurring from the Circumference, towards the lower _Insertions_, it
thus descends. Through which, together with part of the _Sap_ afresh
imbib’d from the Earth, it re-enters the _Pith_. From whence, into
the _Cortical Body_, and from thence into the _Pith_, the cruder part
thereof, is reciprocally disburs’d; while the most _Volatile_, not
needing the help of a _Circulation_, more directly ascendeth towards
the _Trunk_.




                               CHAP. III.

                             _Of the TRUNK._


HAVING thus declar’d the degrees of _Vegetation_ in the _Root_; the
continuance hereof in the _Trunk_ shall next be shew’d: in order to
which, the Parts whereof this likewise is compounded, we shall first
observe.

1. §. That which without dissection shews it self, is the _Coarcture_:
I cannot say of the _Root_, nor of the _Trunk_; but what I choose here
to mention, as standing betwixt them, and so being common to them both;
all their _Parts_ being here bound in closer together, as in the tops
of the grown _Roots_ of very many _Plants_, is apparent.

2. §. Of the _Parts_ of the _Trunk_, the first occurring is its _Skin_:
The Formation whereof, is not from the Air, but in the _Seed_, from
whence it is originated; being the production of the _Cuticle_, there
investing the two _Lobes_ and _Plume_.

3. §. The next _Part_ is the _Cortical Body_; which here in the _Trunk_
is no new substantial Formation; but, as is that of the _Root_,
originated from the _Parenchyma_ of the _Plume_ in the _Seed_; and is
only the increase and augmentation thereof. ♦ _Tab. 3. f. 1, & 4._ ♦
The _Skin_, this _Cortical Body_ or _Parenchyma_, and (for the most
part) some Fibers of the _Lignous_ mixed herewith, altogether make the
_Barque_.

4. §. Next, the _Lignous Body_, which, whether it be visibly divided
into many softer _Fibers_ or small _Threads_, as in the _Bean_,
_Fennel_, and most _Herbs_; ♦ _Tab. 3. f. 1._ ♦ or that its Parts stand
more compact and close, shewing one hard, firm and solid piece, as in
_Trees_; it is, in all, one and the same _Body_; and that not formed
originally in the _Trunk_, but in the _Seed_; being nothing else but
the prolongation of the _Seminal Root_ distributed in the _Lobes_ and
_Plume_ thereof.

5. §. Lastly, The _Insertions_ and _Pith_ are here originated likewise
from the _Plume_, as the same in the _Root_, from the _Radicle_: So
that as to their _Substantial Parts_, the _Lobes_ of the _Seed_, the
_Radicle_ and _Plume_, the _Root_ and _Trunk_ are all one.

6. §. Yet some things are more fairly observable in the _Trunk_. First,
the _Latitudinal_ shootings of the _Lignous Body_, which in _Trunks_ of
several years growth, are apparent in so many _Rings_, as is commonly
known. For several young Fibers of the _Lignous Body_, ♦ _Tab. 3. f.
5, & 8._ ♦ as in the _Root_, so here, shooting in the _Cortical_ one
year, and the spaces betwixt them being after fill’d up with more (I
think not till) the next, at length they become altogether a firm
compact _Ring_; the _Perfection_ of one _Ring_, and the _Ground-work_
of another, being thus made concomitantly.

7. §. From these Annual younger _Fibers_ it is, that although the
_Cortical Body_ and _Pith_ are both of the same substantial nature, and
their _Pores_ little different; yet whereas the _Pith_, which the first
year is green, and of all the _Parts_ the fullest of _Sap_, becomes
afterwards white and dry: The _Cortical Body_, on the contrary, so long
as the _Tree_ grows, ever keepeth green and moist, _sc._ because the
said _Sap-Fibers_, annually grow therein, and so communicate with it.

8. §. The _Pores_ likewise of the _Lignous Body_, many of them, in
well-grown Timber, as in Oaken boards, are very conspicuous, in cutting
both lengthwise and traverse. They very seldom, if ever, run one into
another, but keep, like so many several _Vessels_, all along distinct;
♦ _Tab. 3. f. 2. & 3._ ♦ as by cutting, and so following any one of
them as far as you please, for a Foot or half a Yard, or more together,
may be observ’d. And so, the like, in any _Cane_.

9. §. Besides these, there are a lesser sort; which, by the help only
of a good _Spectacle Glass_ may be observ’d.

10. §. And these are all the _Pores_ visible without a _Microscope_.
The use of which, excepting in some few particulars, I have purposely
omitted in this first _Book_. ♦ Micrography. ♦ Mr. _Hook_ sheweth us,
besides these, a third, and yet smaller Sort; and (as a confirmation
of what, in the Second _Chapter_, ♦ _C. 2. §. 8._ ♦ I have said of the
_Pores_ of the _Lignous Body_ in general) that they are all continuous
and prolonged by the length of the _Trunk_, as are the greater ones:
whereof he maketh Experiment, by filling up, in a piece of _Char-coal_,
all the said _Pores_ with _Mercury_; which appears to pass quite
through them, in that by a very good _Glass_ it is visible in their
Orifices at both ends; and without a _Glass_, by the weight of the Coal
alone, is also manifest. All these I have seen, with the help of a good
_Microscope_, in several sorts of _Woods_. ♦ _Tab. 3. f. 7._ ♦ As
they all appeare in a piece of _Oak_, cut transversely, See _Tab. 3._

11. §. Upon further Enquiry, I likewise find, That the _Pores_ of
the _Lignous Body_ in the _Trunks_ of _Herbs_, which at first I only
supposed, by the help of good _Glasses_, are very fairly visible:
each _Fibre_ being sometimes perforated by 30, 50, 100, or hundreds
of _Pores_. Or what I think is the truest notion of them, That each
_Fibre_, though it seem to the bare eye to be but _one_, yet is,
indeed, a great number of _Fibres_ together; and every _Pore_, being
not meerly a space betwixt the several parts of the Wood, but the
_Concave_ of a _Fiber_. So that if it be asked, what all that Part
of a _Plant_, either _Herb_ or _Tree_, which is properly called the
_Woody-Part_; what all that is, I suppose, That it is nothing else but
a _Cluster_ of innumerable and most extraordinary small _Vessels_ or
_Concave Fibers_: ♦ _Tab. 3. f. 6._ ♦ as in a Slice of the Trunk of
_Burdock_ is apparent.

12. §. Next the _Insertions_ of the _Cortical Body_, which in the
_Trunk_ of a _Tree_ saw’d athwart, are plainly discerned as they run
from the Circumference toward the Center; the whole Body of the _Tree_
being visibly compounded of two distinct Substances, that of the
several _Rings_, and that of the _Insertions_, running cross; shewing
that in some resemblance in a _Plain_, ♦ _Tab. 3. f. 5. & 8._ ♦ which
the _Lines_ of _Latitude_ and of the _Meridian_ do in a _Globe_. The
entrance of the _Insertions_ into the _Wood_, is also, upon striping
off the Barque, very apparent; as in the same _Fig. 8._

13. §. These _Insertions_ are likewise very conspicuous in Sawing of
_Trees_ length-ways into Boards, and those plain’d, and wrought into
_Leaves_ for _Tables_, _Wainscot_, _Trenchers_, and the like. In all
which, as in course _Trenchers_ made of _Beech_, and _Tables_ of _Oak_,
there are many parts which have a greater smoothness than the rest; ♦
_Tab. 3. f. 2. & Tab. 4. f. 1._ ♦ and are so many _inserted Pieces_ of
the _Cortical Body_; which being by those of the _Lignous_, frequently
intercepted, seem to be discontinuous, although in the _Trunk_ they are
really extended, in continued Plates, throughout its Breadth.

14. §. These _Insertions_, although as is said, of a quite distinct
substance from the _Lignous Body_, and so no where truly incorporated
with it, yet being they are in all parts, the one as the _Warp_, the
other as the _Woof_, mutually _braced_ and _interwoven_ together, they
thus constitute one strong and firmly coherent Body; ♦ _Tab. 4. f. 1._
♦ as the Timber of any _Tree_.

15. §. As the Pores or Vessels are greater or less, so are the
_Insertions_ also: To the bare eye usually the greater only are
discernable: But through an indifferent _Microscope_ there are others
also, much more both numerous and small, distinctly apparent,
♦ _Tab. 3. f. 7._ ♦ as in a transverse piece of _Oak_.

16. §. In none of all the _Pores_ can we observe any thing which may
have the true nature and use of _Valves_, which is, Easily to admit
that, to which they will by no means allow a regress. And their
nonexistence is enough evident, from what in the first _Chapter_ ♦
_C. 1. §. 42._ ♦ we have said of the _Lobes_ of the _Seed_: in whose
_Seminal Root_, were there any _Valves_, it could not be, that by a
contrary _Course_ of the _Sap_, they should ever grow; which yet,
where-ever they turn into _Dissimilar Leaves_, they do. Or if we
consider the growth of the _Root_, which oftentimes is _upward_ and
_downward_ both at once. And being cut transversely, will bleed, both
the same ways, with equal freedom.

17. §. The _Insertions_ here in the _Trunk_ give us likewise a sight of
the position of their _Pores_. For in a plained piece of _Oak_, as in
_Wainscot_, _Tables_, _&c._ besides the larger _Pores_ of the _Lignous
Body_, which run by the _length_ of the _Trunk_; ♦ _Tab. 3. f. 2._ ♦
the _Tract_ likewise of those of the _Insertions_ may be observed to
be made by the breadth, and so directly cross. Nor are they continuous
as those of the _Lignous Body_, but very short, as those both of the
_Cortical Body_ and _Pith_, with which the _Insertions_, as to their
substance, are congenerous. Yet they all stand so together, as to be
plainly ranked in even _Lines_ or _Rows_ throughout the breadth of the
_Trunk_: As the _Tract_ of those _Pores_ appears to the naked Eye, see
in _Tab. 3. Fig. 9._ The _Pores_ themselves may be seen in the _Root_
of a _Vine_ described and figured in the Second _Book_, as it appears
through a good _Microscope_. ♦ _Tab. 17._ ♦

18. §. The _Pores_ of the _Pith_ likewise being larger here in
the _Trunk_, are better observable than in the _Root_: the width
whereof, in comparison with their _Sides_ so exquisitely thin, may
by an _Hony-Comb_ be grosly exemplified; and is that also which the
vast disproportion betwixt the Bulk and Weight of a dry _Pith_ doth
enough declare. In the _Trunks_ of some _Plants_, they are so ample
and transparent, that in cutting both by the length and breadth of
the _Pith_, some of them through the transparency of the _Skins_ by
which they are bounded, or of which they consist, would seem to be
considerably extended by the length of the _Pith_; but are really
discontinuous and short, and as ’tis said, somewhat answerable to the
_Cells_ of an _Hony-Comb_. This is the nearest we can come to them,
by the bare Eye without the assistance of a good _Microscope_. Mr.
_Hook_ sheweth in his _Micrography_, That the _Pores_ of the _Pith_,
particularly of _Elder-Pith_, so far as they are visible, are all alike
discontinuous; and that the _Pith_ is nothing else but (as he calls
them) an heap of _Bubbles_. Although, in regard they are not fluid,
but fixed Parts, I shall choose rather to call them, _Bladders_. As
they appear through a good _Glass_, in a piece of _Burdock_, See in
_Tab. 3._ ♦ _Tab. 3. f. 6._ ♦ But a more particular Description of the
_Sizes_, _Figures_, and admirable _Textures_ hereof, I have given in
several places in the following _Books_.

19. §. Besides what this Observation informs us of here, it farther
confirms what in the Second _Chapter_ ♦ _C. 2. §. 3, 16, 17._ ♦ we have
said of the Original of the _Pith_ and _Cortical Body_, and of the
sameness of both their natures with the _Parenchyma_ of the _Seed_:
which is nothing else but a Mass of _Bladders_; ♦ _C. 1. §. 18. & Tab.
1. f. 9._ ♦ as in the First _Chapter_ hath been said.

20. §. In the _Piths_ of many _Plants_, the greater _Pores_ or
_Bladders_ have some of them lesser ones within them, and some of them
are divided with cross Membranes: And betwixt their several sides,
have, I think, other smaller _Bladders_ visibly interjected. However,
that they are all permeable, is most certain. They stand together
not confusedly, but in even _Ranks_ or _Trains_; as those of the
_Insertions_ by the breadth, so these by the length of the _Trunk_.
And thus far there is a general corresponding betwixt the parts of the
_Root_ and _Trunk_. Yet are there some considerable Disparities betwixt
them; wherein, and how they come to pass, and to what especial Use and
End, shall next be said.


♦ An Account of the _Growth_ of the _Trunk_. ♦ 21. §. WE SAY then, that
the _Sap_ being in the _Root_ by Filtrations, Fermentations (and in
what _Roots_ needful, perhaps by Circulation also) duly prepar’d; the
prime part thereof passing through the intermediate _Coarcture_, in
due moderation and purity is entertain’d at last into the _Trunk_. And
the _Sap_ of the _Trunk_ being purer and more volatile, and so it self
apt to ascend; the motion of the _Trunk_ likewise will be more noble,
receiving a disposition and tendency to ascend therewith. And what by
the _Sap_ the _Trunk_ is in part dipos’d to, by the respective position
and quantity of its Parts it is effectually enabled. For whereas in
the _Root_ the _Lignous Body_ being in proportion with the _Cortical_,
but little, and all lying close within its Center; it must therefore
needs be under its controul: on the contrary, being here comparatively
of greater quantity, and also more dilated, and having divers of its
Branches standing more abroad towards the Circumference, as both in the
_Leaves_ and Body of the young _Trunk_ and _Plume_, is seen; it will in
its own _magnetical_ tendency to _ascend_, reduce the _Cortical Body_
to a compliance with it.

22. §. And the _Trunk_ thus standing from under the restraint of the
Ground in the open Air, the disposition of its _Parts_, originally
different from that of the _Parts_ in the _Root_, will not only be
continued, but improved. For by the force and pressure of the _Sap_
in its collateral Motion, the _Lignous Body_ will now more freely and
farther be dilated. And this being dilated, the _Cortical Body_ also,
must needs be _inserted_; and is therefore in proportion always, more
or less, smaller here in the _Trunk_, than in the _Root_. And as the
_Cortical Body_ lessens, so the _Pith_ will be enlarged, and by the
same proportion is here greater. And the _Pith_ being enlarged it
self, its _Pores_ (the _Lignous Body_, upon its dilatation, as it were
tentering and stretching out all their sides) must needs likewise be
enlarged with it; and accordingly, are ever greater in the _Pith_ of
the _Trunk_, than of the _Root_. And the dilatation of the _Lignous
Body_ still continued, it follows, that whereas the _Pith_ descendent
in the _Root_, is not only in proportion less and less, but also in the
smaller extremities thereof, and sometimes higher, altogether absent:
Contrariwise, in the _Trunk_, it is not only continued to its top and
smallest _Twigs_, but also there, in proportion, equally ample with
what it is in any other inferiour part.

23. §. But although the openness of the Aer permitting, be always
alike; yet the Energy of the _Sap_ effecting, being different; as
therefore that doth, the dilatation of the _Trunk_, will also vary. If
that be less, so is this; as in the _Trunks_ of most _Trees_: If that
be greater, so this; as in _Herbs_ is common; the _Lignous Body_ being
usually so far dilated, that the _utmost Shootings_ thereof may easily
be seen to jut out, and adjoyn to the _Skin_. And if the _Sap_ be still
of greater energy, it so far dilates the _Lignous Body_, as not only
to amplifie the _Pith_ and all its _Pores_; but also so far to stretch
them out, as to make them tear. Whereupon either running again into the
_Cortical Body_, or shrinking up towards it, the _Trunk_ thus sometimes
becomes an _hollow Stalk_, the _Pith_ being wholly, or in part voided.
But generally it keeps entire; and where it doth, the same proportion
and respect to the _Lignous_ and _Cortical Bodies_, as is said. The
Consequences of all which will be, the _Strength_ of the _Trunk_,
the _Security_ and _Plenty_ of the _Sap_, its _Fermentation_ will be
quicker, its _Distribution_ more effectual, and its _Advancement_ more
sufficient.

24. §. First, the Erect Growth and Strength of the _Trunk_; this
being, by the position of its several Parts, effected: for besides the
slendering of the _Trunk_ still towards the top, the _Circumferential_
position of the _Lignous Body_, likewise is, and that eminently,
hereunto subservient. So that as the _Lignous Body_, in the smaller
parts, of the _Root_ standing Central, we may thence conceive and see
their pliableness to any oblique motion; so here, on the contrary,
the _Lignous Body_ standing wide, it thus becomes the Strength of the
_Trunk_, and most advantageous to its Perpendicular Growth. We see the
same Design in _Bones_ and _Feathers_: The strongest _Bones_, as those
in the Legs, are hollow. Now should we suppose the same _Bone_, to be
contracted into a Solid; although now it would be no heavier, and in
that respect, as apt for motion; yet would it have far less strength,
than as its Parts are dilated to a _Circumferential_ posture. And so
for _Quills_, which, for the same Reasons, in subserviency to flying,
as they are exceeding light; So, in comparison with the thinness of
their _Sides_, they are very strong, and much less apt to bend, than
if contracted into a Solid _Cylinder_. We see it not only in _Nature_,
but _Art_. For hence it is, that _Joyners_ and _Carpenters_ unite and
set together their Timber-pieces and several Works oftentimes with
double Joynts; which, although they are no thicker, than a single one
might be made; yet standing at a distance, have a greater strength than
That could have. And the same Architecture, will have the same use, in
the _Trunks_ of _Plants_; in most whereof ’tis very apparent; as for
instance, in _Corn_. For _Nature_ designing its _Sap_ a great Ascent;
for its higher maturity, hath given it a tall _Trunk_: But to prevent
its ravenous despoiling either of the _Ear_, or _Soyl_; although it be
tall, yet are its sides but thin: And because again, it should grow not
only tall and thriftily, but for avoiding propping up, strongly too;
therefore, the same proportion as its heigth bears, to the thinness of
its sides, doth the greatness of its Circumference also; being so far
dilated as to parallel a _Quil_ it self.

25. §. Besides the position of the _Lignous Body_ within the compass of
a _Ring_, there are some _Shootings_ thereof, often standing beyond the
Circumference of the said _Ring_, making sometimes a triangular, oftner
a quadrangular Body of the _Trunk_. To the end, that the _Ring_, being
but thin, and not self-sufficient, these, like _Splinters_ to _Bones_,
might add strength and stability to it.

26. §. Next, the security and plenty of the _Sap_. For should the
_Lignous Body_, as it doth in the smaller Parts of the _Root_, stand
Central here also, and so the _Cortical_ wholly surround it: the
greater part of the _Sap_ would thus be more immediately expos’d to the
_Sun_ and _Aer_; and being lodged in a laxe Body, by them continually
be prey’d upon, and as fast as supplied to the _Trunk_, be exhausted.
Whereas, the _Pith_ standing in the Center, the _Sap_ therein being not
only most remote from the _Aer_ and _Sun_, but by the _Barque_, and
especially the _Wood_, being also surrounded and doubly immur’d, will
very securely and copiously be convey’d to all the Collateral Parts,
and (as shall be said how) the top of the _Trunk_.

27. §. And the _Sap_ by the amplitude, and great porosity of the
_Pith_, being herein more copious, its Fermentation also will be
quicker; which we see in all Liquors, by standing in a greater quantity
together, proceeds more kindly: And being _tun’d up_ within the _Wood_,
is at the same time not only secur’d from loss, but all extream
mutations; the Day being thus, not too hot; nor the Night, too cold for
it.

28. §. And the Fermentation hereof being quicker, its motion also
will be stronger, and its Distribution more effectual, not only to
the dilatation of the _Trunk_, but likewise the shooting out of the
_Branches_. Whence it is, that in the Bodies of _Trees_, the _Barque_
of it self, though it be Sappy, and many _Fibres_ of the _Lignous Body_
mixed with it, yet seldom sendeth forth any; and that in _Herbs_, those
with the least _Pith_ (other advantages not supplying this defect) have
the fewest or smallest Branches, or other collateral Growths: and that
_Corn_, which hath no _Pith_, hath neither any Branches.

29. §. Lastly, the Advancement of the _Sap_ will hence also be more
ready and sufficient. For the understanding where, and how, we suppose,
That in all _Trunks_ whatsoever there are two Parts joyntly hereunto
subservient. In some, the _Lignous Body_ and the _Cortical_, as in
older _Trunks_; the _Pith_ being either excluded, or dried: But in
most, principally, the _Lignous Body_ and _Pith_; as in most Annual
Growths of _Trees_; but especially _Herbs_, where the _Cortical Body_
is usually much and often wholly Inserted.

30. §. Of the _Lignous Body_ it is so apparent by its _Pores_, or
rather by its _Vessels_, that we need no farther Evidence. For to what
end are _Vessels_, but for the conveyance of Liquor? And is that also,
which upon cutting the young Branch of a Sappy _Tree_ or _Herb_, by an
accurate and steady view may be observed. But when I say the _Vessels_
of the _Lignous Body_, I mean principally them of the _younger
shootings_, both those which make the _new Ring_, and those which are
mixed with the _Cortical Body_ in the _Barque_: that which ascendeth
by the _Pores_ or _Vessels_ of the Wood, being probably, because in
less quantity, more in form of a _Vapour_, than a _Liquor_. Yet that
which drenching into the sides of its _Pores_, is with all thereunto
sufficient Aliment; as we see _Orpine_, _Onions_, _&c._ only standing
in a moyster Aer will often grow. And being likewise in part supplied
by the _Insertions_ from the younger _Shoots_: But especially because
as it is but little, so (considered as Aliment) it serveth only for the
growth of the _Wood_, and no more; whereas, the more copious Aliment
ascendent by the younger _Shoots_, subserves not only their own growth,
but the generation of others; and is besides with that in the _Cortical
Body_ the Fountain of _Perspirations_, which we know even in _Animals_
are much more abundant than the _Nutritive Parts_; and doubtless in a
_Vegetable_ are still much more.

31. §. But these _Pores_, although they are a free and open way to
the ascending _Sap_; yet that meer _Pores_ or _Vessels_ should be
able of themselves to advance the _Sap_ with that speed, strength
and plenty, and to that height, as is necessary, cannot probably be
supposed. It follows then, that herein we must grant the _Pith_ a joynt
service. And why else is the _Pith_ in all Primitive _Growths_ the most
_Sappy_ part, why hath it so great a stock of _Sap_, if not, after due
maturation within it self, still to be disbursed into the _Fibres_ of
the _Lignous Body_? Why are the Annual _Growths_ of all both _Herbs_
and _Trees_, with great _Piths_, the quickest and the longest? But how
are the _Pores_ or _Bladders_ of the _Pith_ permeable? That they are
so, both from their being capable of a repletion with _Sap_, and of
being again wholly emptied of it, and again, instead thereof fill’d
with _Aer_, is as certain as that they are _Pores_. That they are
permeable, by the breadth, appears from the dilatation of the _Lignous
Body_, and from the production of _Branches_, as hath been, and shall
hereafter be said. And how else is there a Communion betwixt _This_ and
the _Cortical Body_? That they are so also, by the length, is probable,
because by the best _Microscope_ we cannot yet observe, that they are
visibly more open by the breadth, than by the length. And withall are
ranked by the length, as those of the _Insertions_ by the breadth of
the _Trunk_. But if you set a piece of dry _Elder-Pith_ in some tinged
Liquor, why then doth it not penetrate the _Pores_, so as to ascend
through the Body of the _Pith_? The plain reason is, because they are
all fill’d with _Aer_. Whereas the _Pith_ in a Vegetating _Plant_,
as its Parts or _Bladders_ are still generated, they are at the same
time also fill’d with _Sap_; which, as ’tis gradually spent, is still
repaired by more succeeding, and so the _Aer_ still kept out; as in
all Primitive _Growths_, and the _Pith_ of _Elder_ it self: Yet the
same _Pith_, by reason of the following Winter, wanting a more copious
and quick supply of _Sap_, thus once become, ever after keeps dry.
And since in the aforesaid Trial the Liquor only ascends by the sides
of the _Pith_, that is of its broken _Bladder_, we should thence by
the same reason conclude that they are not penetrable by the breadth
neither, and so no way; and then it need not be ask’d what would
follow. But certainly the _Sap_ in the _Bladders_ of the _Pith_ is
discharged and repaired every moment, as by its shriv’ling up, upon
cutting the _Plant_, is evident.

32. §. We suppose then, that as the _Sap_ ascendeth into the _Trunk_
by the _Lignous Body_, so partly also by the _Pith_. For a piece of
_Cotton_ with one end immers’d in some tinged Liquor, and with the
other erect above, though it will not imbibe the Liquor so far as to
over-run at the top, yet so as to advance towards it, it will. So here,
the _Pith_, being a porous and spongy Body, and in its Vegetating
state, its _Pores_ or _Bladders_ being also permeable, as a curious
_Filtre_ of _Natures_ own contrivance, it thus advanceth, or as people
use to say, sucks up the _Sap_. Yet as it is seen of the Liquor in the
_Cotton_; so likewise are we to suppose it of the _Sap_ in the _Pith_;
that though it riseth up for some way, yet is their some term, beyond
which it riseth not, and towards which the motion of the ascending
_Sap_ is more and more broken, weak and slow, and so the quantity
thereof less and less. But because the _Sap_ moveth not only by the
length, but breadth of the _Pith_; at the same time therefore as it
partly ascendeth by the _Pith_, it is likewise in part pressed into
the _Lignous Body_ or into its _Pores_. And since the motion of the
_Sap_ by the breadth of the _Pith_ not being far continued, and but
collateral, is more prone and easie, than the perpendicular, or by its
length; it therefore follows, that the collateral motion of the _Sap_,
at such a height or part of the _Pith_, will be equally strong with
the perpendicular at another part, though somewhat beneath it; and
that where the perpendicular is more broken and weak, the collateral
will be less; and consequently where the perpendicular tendency of
the _Sap_ hath its term, the collateral tendency thereof, and so its
pressure into the _Pores_ or _Vessels_ of the _Lignous Body_, will
still continue. Through which, in that they are small, and so their
sides almost contiguous, the _Sap_ as fast as pressed into them will
easily run up; as in very small Glasse Pipes, or betwixt the two halves
of a Stick first slit, and then tyed somewhat loosely together, may
also any Liquor be observed to do. By which Advantage the facility and
strength of that ascent will be continued higher in the said _Vessels_,
than in the _Pith_. Yet since this also, as well as that in the _Pith_
will have its term; the _Sap_, although got thus far, would at last
be stagnant, or at least its ascent be very sparing, slow and feeble,
if not some way or other re-inforced. Wherefore, as the _Sap_ moving
by the breadth of the _Pith_, presseth thence into the _Vessels_ of
the _Lignous Body_; so having well fill’d these, is in part by the
same Collateral motion disbursed back, into a yet higher Region of the
_Pith_. By which partly, and partly, by that portion of the _Sap_,
which in its perpendicular ascent was before lodged therein; ’tis thus
here, as in any inferiour place equally replenished. Whereupon the
force and vigour of the perpendicular motion of the _Sap_ herein, will
likewise be renew’d; and so its Collateral motion also, and so its
pressure into the _Vessels_ of the _Lignous Body_, and consequently its
ascent therein: and so by a pressure, from these into the _Pith_, and
from the _Pith_ into these, reciprocally carried on; a most ready and
copious ascent of the _Sap_ will be continued, from the bottom to the
top, though of the highest _Tree_.




                             _An Appendix._

                     _Of Trunk-Roots and Claspers._


THE distinct _Parts_ whereof these are composed, are the same with
those of the _Trunk_, and but the continuation of them.

1. §. _Trunk-Roots_ are of two kinds: Of the one, are those that
vegetate by a direct descent: The place of their Eruption is sometimes
all along the _Trunk_; as in _Mint_, &c. Sometimes only at its utmost
point, as in the _Bramble_.

2. §. The other sort are such as neither ascend nor descend, but shoot
forth at right Angles with the _Trunk_; which therefore, though as to
their _Office_, they are true _Roots_, yet as to their _Nature_, they
are a _Middle Thing_ betwixt a _Root_ and a _Trunk_.

3. §. _Claspers_, though they are but of one kind, yet their Nature is
double; not a mean betwixit that of the _Root_ and that of the _Trunk_,
but a compound of both; as in their Circumvolutions, wherein they often
mutually ascend and descend, is seen.

4. §. The use of these _Parts_ may be observed as the _Trunk_ Mounts,
or as it Trails. In the mounting of the _Trunk_, they are for Support
and Supply. For Support, we see the _Claspers_ of _Vines_: the
_Branches_ whereof being very long, fragile and slender; unless by
their _Claspers_, they were mutually contain’d together, they must
needs by their own weight, and that of their Fruit, undecently fall;
and be also liable to frequent breaking. So that the whole care is
divided betwixt the Gardener and Nature; the Gardener, with his
Ligaments of Leather, secures the main Branches; and Nature, with these
of her own finding, secures the Less. Their Conveniency to which end,
is seen in their _Circumvolutions_, a motion, not proper to any other
_Part_: As also in their toughness, though much more slender than the
_Branches_ whereon they are appendent.

5. §. The _Claspers_ of _Bryony_ have a retrograde motion about every
Third _Circle_, to the form a Doublet-Clasp. Probably for the more
certain hold; which, if it miss one way, it may be sure to take another.

6. §. For Supply, we see the _Trunk-Roots_ of _Ivy_. For mounting very
high, and being of a closer or more compact Substance than that of
a _Vine_; the _Sap_ could not be sufficiently supplied to the upper
_Sprouts_, unless these, to the _Mother-Root_, were joyntly assistant.
Yet serve they for support likewise; whence they shoot out, not as in
_Cresses_, _Brook-lime_, &c. reciprocally on each side, but commonly,
all on one; that so they may be fastned at the nearest hand.

7. §. In the Trailing of the _Trunk_, they serve for stabiliment,
propagation and shade. For stabiliment, the _Claspers_ of _Cucumbers_
are of good use. For the _Trunk_ and _Branches_ being long and fragile,
the Brushes of the Winds would injuriously hoise them to and fro, to
the dammage both of themselves and their tender Fruits, were they not
by these Ligaments brought to good Association and Settlement.

8. §. As for this end, so for Propagation, the _Trunk-Roots_ of
_Chamæmile_ do well serve. Whence we have the reason of the common
observation, that it grows better by being trod upon: the Mould, where
too laxe, being thus made to lie more conveniently about the said
_Trunk-Roots_ newly bedded therein; and is that which is sometimes also
effected in Rowling of _Corn_.

9. §. For both these ends, Serve the _Trunk-Roots_ of _Strawberries_;
as also for shade; for in that all _Strawberries_ delight; and by the
trailing of the _Plant_ is well obtain’d. So that as we are wont to
tangle the Twigs of _Trees_ together to make an _Arbour Artificial_;
the same is here done to make a _Natural one_: as likewise by the
_Claspers_ of _Cucumbers_. For the _Branches_ of the one by the Linking
of their _Claspers_, and of the other by the Tethering of their
_Trunk-Roots_, being couched together; their tender Fruits thus lie
under the Umbrage of a _Bower_ made of their own Leaves.




                                CHAP. IV.

                   _Of the GERMEN, BRANCH, and LEAF._


THE Parts of the _Germen_ and _Branch_, are the same with those of the
_Trunk_; the same _Skin_, _Cortical_ and _Lignous Bodies_, _Insertment_
and _Pith_, hereinto propagated, and distinctly observable herein.

2. §. For upon Enquiry into the Original of a _Branch_ or _Germen_,
it appears, That it is not from the _Superficies_ of the _Trunk_; but
so deep, as to take, with the _Cortical_, the _Lignous Body_ into it
self: and that, not only from its Circumference, but from its _Inner_
or _Central Parts_; So as to take the _Pith_ in also. Divers of which
_Parts_ may commonly be seen to shoot out into the _Pith_; from which
_Shoots_, the surrounding and more superiour _Germens_ are originated;
in like manner as the Succulent Part of the _Lignous Body_ of the
_Trunk_ is sometimes principally from those Fibrous _Shoots_ which run
along the _Pith_ in the _Root_.

3. §. The manner wherein usually the _Germen_ and _Branch_ are fram’d,
is briefly thus: The _Sap_ (as is said, _Chap. 3._) mounting in the
_Trunk_, will not only by its length, but by its breadth also, through
the _Insertions_ partly move. Yet, its Particles being not all alike
qualified, in different degrees. Some are more gross and sluggish; of
which we have the formation of a Circle of Wood only, or of an _Annual
Ring_. Others are more brisk; and by these, we have the _Germen_
propagated. For by the vigour of their own motion from the Center,
they impress an equal tendency on some of the inner _Portions_ of the
_Lignous Body_ next adjacent to the _Pith_, to move with them. And
since the _Lignous Body_ is not entire, but frequently disparted;
through these _Dispartments_, the said interiour _Portions_, upon their
Nutrition, actually shoot; not only towards the Circumference, so as to
make part of a _Ring_; but even beyond it, in order to the production
of a _Germen_. And the _Lignous Body_ thus moving, and carrying the
_Cortical_ along with it; they both make a force upon the _Skin_. Yet
their motion being most even and gradual, that force is such likewise;
not to cause the least breach of its parts, but gently to carry it
on with themselves; and so partly, by the extension of its already
existent parts, as of those of _Gold_ in drawing of Guilded _Wyer_; and
partly, by the accretion of new ones, as in the enlarging of a _Bubble_
above the Surface of the Water; it is extended with them to their
utmost growth. In which growth, the _Germen_ being prolonged, and so
displaying its several parts, as when a _Prospective_ or _Telescope_ is
drawn out, thus becomes a _Branch_.

4. §. The same way as the propagation of the _Parts_ of a _Germen_
is contriv’d, is its due nutrition also. For being originated from
the inner part of the _Lignous Body_, ’tis nourished with the best
fermented _Sap_ in the _Trunk_, _sc._ that next adjacent to it in the
_Pith_. Besides, since all its _Parts_, upon their shooting forth,
divaricate from their perpendicular, to a cross Line, as these and the
other grow and thrive together, they bind and throng each other into a
_Knot_: through which _Knot_ the _Sap_ being strain’d, ’tis thus, in
due moderation and purity delivered up into the _Branch_.

5. §. And for _Knots_, they are so necessary, as to be seen not only
where collateral _Branches_ put forth; but in such _Plants_ also, as
shoot up in one single _Trunk_; as in _Corn_. Wherein, as they make
for the strength of the _Trunk_; so by so many percolations, as they
are _Knots_, for the transmission of the _Sap_ more and more refined
towards the _Ear_. So that the two general uses of _Knots_ are, For
_firmer standing_, and _finer growth_.

6. §. Lastly, as the due Formation and Nutrition of the _Germen_ are
provided for, so is its security also; which both in its position upon
the _Trunk_, and that of its _Parts_ among themselves, may be observed.
The position of its _Parts_ shall be considered in speaking of the
_Leaf_. As to its standing in the _Trunk_, ’tis alwayes betwixt the
_trunk_ or _older Branch_, and the _Basis_ of the Stalk of a _Leaf_;
whereby it is not only guarded from the Injuries of any contingent
Violence; but also from the more piercing assaults of the Cold; so
long, till in time ’tis grown larger, and more hardy. The manner and
uses of the position of every _Germen_, considered as after it becomes
a _Branch_; hath already been, ♦ Hist. of the _Prop._ of _Veget._ ♦
by the Ingenious Mr. _Sharrock_ very well observed; to whom I refer.


7. §. UPON THE prolongation of the _Germen_ into a _Branch_, its
_Leaves_ are thus display’d. The _Parts_ whereof are substantially the
same with those of a _Branch_. For the _Skin_ of the _Leaf_, is only
the ampliation of that of the _Branch_; being partly by the accretion
of new, and partly the extention of its already existent parts, dilated
(as in making of _Leaf-Gold_) into its present breadth. The _Fibres_ or
_Nerves_ dispersed through the _Leaf_, are only the Ramifications of
the _Branch’s_ Wood, or _Lignous Body_. The _Parenchyma_ of the _Leaf_,
which lies betwixt the _Nerves_, and as in Gentlewomens Needle-works,
fills all up, is nothing else, but the continuation of the _Cortical
Body_, or _Parenchymous_ part of the _Barque_ from the _Branch_ into it
self, as in most _Plants_ with a thick _Leaf_, may easily be seen.

8. §. The _Fibers_ of the _Leaf_ neither shoot out of the _Branch_, or
the _Trunk_, nor stand in the _Stalk_, in an _even_ Line; but alwayes
in either an _Angular_ or _Circular_ posture; and usually making
either a _Triangle_, or a _Semi-Circle_, or _Chord_ of a Circle; as in
_Cichory_, _Endive_, _Cabbage_, &c. may be observed. ♦ _Tab. 4. f. 2._
to _f. 11._ ♦ And if the _Leaf_ have but one main _Fiber_, that also
is postur’d in a bowed or _Lunar_ Figure; as in _Mint_ and others. The
usual number of these _Vascular Threds_ or _Fibres_ is 3, 5, or 7.

9. §. The reason of the said Positions of the _Fibers_ in the _Stalk_
of the _Leaf_, is for its more _Erect_ growth, and greater _Strength_:
which, were the position of the said _Fibers_ in an _even Line_, and so
the _Stalk_ it self as well as the _Leaf_, flat; must needs have been
defective; as from what we have said of the Circumferential posture of
the _Lignous Body_ in the _Trunk_, ♦ _C. 3. §. 24._ ♦ we may better
conceive.

10. §. As likewise for the security of its _Sap_: For by this means
it is, that the several _Fibers_, and especially the main or middle
_Fiber_ of the _Leaf_, together with a considerable part of the
_Parenchyma_, are so disposed of, as to jut out, not from its upper,
but its back, or nether Side. Whence the whole _Leaf_, reclining
backward, becomes a Canopy to them, defending them from those Injuries
which from colder Blasts, or an hotter Sun, they might otherwise
sustain. So that by a mutual benefit, as These give _suck_ to all the
_Leaf_, so that again _protection_ to These.

11. §. These _Fibers_ are likewise the immediate Visible Cause of the
Shape of the _Leaf_. For if the nethermost _Fiber_ or _Fibers_ in the
_Stalk_ (which thence runs chiefly through the length of the _Leaf_) be
in proportion greater, the _Leaf_ is long; as in _Endive_, _Cichory_,
and others: If all of a more equal size, it spreads rounder, as in
_Ivy_, _Doves-foot_, _Colts foot_, &c. And although a _Dock-Leaf_ be
very long, whose _Fibers_ notwithstanding, as they stand higher in the
_Stalk_, are disposed into a _Circle_ all of an equal size; yet herein
one or more peculiar _Fibres_, ♦ _Tab. 4._ ♦ standing, in or near the
_Center_, betwixt the rest, and running through the length of the
_Leaf_, may be observed.

12. §. In correspondence also to the size and shape of these _Fibres_,
is the _Leaf_ flat. In that either they are very small, or if larger,
yet they never make an entire Circle or _Ring_; but either half of one,
as in _Borage_, or at most three parts of one, as in _Mullen_, may be
seen. ♦ _Tab. 4._ ♦ For if either they were so big, as to contain, or
so entire, as perfectly to include a _Pith_, the Energy of the _Sap_
in that _Pith_, would cause the said _Lignous Ring_ to shoot forth on
every side, as it doth in the _Root_ or _Trunk_: But the said _Fibers_
being not figur’d into an entire _Ring_, but so as to be open; on
that hand therefore where open they cannot shoot any thing directly
from themselves, because there they have nothing to shoot; and the
_Sap_ having also a free vent through the said opening, against that
part therefore which is thereunto opposite, it can have no force;
and so neither will they shoot forth on that hand; and so will they
consequently, that way only, which the force of the _Sap_ directs,
which is only on the right and left.

13. §. The several _Fibers_ in the _Stalk_, are all Inosculated in the
_Leaf_, with very many Sub-divisions. According as these _Fibers_ are
Inosculated near, or at, or shoot directly to the edge of the _Leaf_,
is it Even, or Scallop’d. Where these _Inosculations_ are not made,
there we have no _Leaves_, but only a company of _Filaments_; as in
_Fennel_.

14. §. To the _Formations_ of _Leaves_, the _Fouldings_ immediately
follow. And sometimes they have one Date, or are the contemporary works
of _Nature_; each _Leaf_ obtaining its distinct shape, and proper
posture together; both being perfect, not only in the outer, but
Central and minutest _Leaves_, which are five hundred times smaller
than the outer: both which in the Cautious opening of a _Germen_ may be
seen.

15. §. Nor is there greater Art in the _Forms_, than in the _Foulds_
or _Postures_ of _Leaves_; both answerably varying, as this or that
way they may be most agreeable. ♦ Treat. of the _Quincunx_. ♦ Of the
_Quincuncial_ posture, so amply instanc’d in by the Learned Sir _Thomas
Brown_, I shall omit to speak. Others there are, which though not all
so universal, yet equally necessary where they are, giving two general
advantages to the _Leaves_, _Elegancy_ and _Security_, _sc._ in taking
up, so as their _Forms_ will bear, the least room; and in being so
conveniently couch’d, as to be capable of receiving protection from
other Parts, or of giving it one to another; as for instance,

16. §. First, There is the _Bow-Lap_, where the _Leaves_ are all laid
somewhat convexly one over another, but not plaited; being to the
length, breadth and number of _Leaves_ most agreeable; as in the Buds
of _Pear-tree_, _Plum-tree_, &c. But where the _Leaves_ are not so
thick set, as to stand in the _Bow-Lap_, there we have the _Plicature_,
or the _Flat-Lap_; as in _Rose-Tree_, _Strawberry_, _Cinquefoyl_,
_Burnet_, &c. For the _Leaves_ being here plaited, and so lying in half
their breadth, and divers of them thus also collaterally set together;
the thickness of them all, and half their breadth, are much alike
dimensions; by which they stand more secure within themselves, and in
better consort with other _Germen-Growths_ in the same _Truss_. If the
_Leaves_ be much indented or jagg’d, now we have the _Duplicature_;
wherein there are divers _Plaits_ in one _Leaf_, or _Labels_ of a
_Leaf_, but in distinct _Sets_, a lesser under a greater; as in
_Souchus_, _Tansey_, &c. When the _Leaves_ stand not collaterally, but
single; and are moreover very broad; then we have the _Multiplicature_;
as in _Gooseberries_, _Mallows_, &c. the _Plaits_ being not only
divers in the same _Leaf_, but of the same _Set_ continuant, and so
each _Leaf_ gather’d up in five, seven or more _Foulds_, in the same
manner as our Gentlewomens Fans. Where either the thickness of the
_Leaf_ will not permit a _Flat-Lap_, or the fewness of their number,
or the smalness of their _Fibers_, will allow the _Rowl_, there This
may be observed. Which is sometimes single, as in _Bears-Ears_, _Arum_,
_Flammula_, _Jerusalem Cowslip_, &c. Sometimes double, the two _Rowls_
beginning at each edge of the _Leaf_, and meeting in the middle. Which
again, is either the _Fore-Rowl_, or the _Back-Rowl_. If the _Leaf_
be design’d to grow long, now we have the _Back-Rowl_, as in _Docks_,
_Sorrels_, and the rest of this Kindred: as also in _Primrose_,
and other like _Plants_. For the main _Fibers_, and therewith a
considerable part of the _Cortical Body_ standing prominent from the
_Back-side_ of the _Leaf_, they thus stand securely couch’d up betwixt
the two _Rowls_; on whose security the growth of the _Leaf_ in length
depends. But those of _Bears-Ears_, _Violets_, _Doves Foot_, _Warden_,
and many more, upon contrary respects, are rowled up inwards. Lastly,
there is the _Tre-Rowl_, as in _Fern_; the _Labels_ whereof, though all
rowled up to the _main Stem_, yet could not stand so firm and secure
from the Injuries either of the _Ground_ or _Weather_, unless to the
_Rowls_ in breadth, that by the length were super-induc’d; the _Stalk_
or _main Stem_ giving the same Protection here, which in other _Plants_
by the _Leaves_, or some particular _Mantling_, is contriv’d. These,
and other _Foulds_, See in the _Figures_ belonging to the _First_
=Part= of the _Fourth_ =Book=.

17. §. According to the _Form_ and _Foulding_ of every _Leaf_ or
_Germen_, is its Protection order’d; about six ways whereof may be
observ’d; _sc._ by _Leaves_, _Surfoyls_, _Interfoyls_, _Stalks_,
_Hoods_ and _Mantlings_. To add to what we have above given, one or two
Instances. Every _Bud_, besides its proper _Leaves_, is covered with
divers Leafy _Pannicles_ or _Surfoyls_; which, what the _Leaves_ are to
one another, are that to them all: For not opening except gradually,
they admit not the _Weather_, _Wet_, _Sun_ or _Aer_, to approach the
_Leaves_, except by degrees respondent, and as they are gradually
inur’d to bear them. Sometimes, besides _Surfoyls_, there are also
many _Interfoyls_ set betwixt the _Leaves_, from the Circumference to
the Center of the _Bud_; as in the _Hasel_. For the _Fibres_ of these
_Leaves_ standing out so far from a plain surface; they would, if not
thus shelter’d, lie too much expos’d and naked to the _Severities_
of the _Weather_. Where none of all the Protections above-named, are
convenient, there the _Membranes_ of the _Leaves_ by continuation
in their first forming (together with some _Fibres_ of the _Lignous
Body_) are drawn out into so many _Mantles_ or _Veils_; as in _Docks_,
_Snakeweed_, &c. For the _Leaves_ here being but few, yet each _Leaf_
and its _Stalk_ being both exceeding long; at the bottom whereof the
next following _Leaf_ still springs up; the form and posture of all
is such, as supersedes all the other kinds of Protection, and so each
_Leaf_ apart is provided with a _Veil_ to it self. These, and other
_Protections_, See in the _Figures_ belonging to the _First_ =Part= of
the _Fourth_ =Book=.

18. §. The Uses of the _Leaves_, I mean in respect of their service to
the _Plant_ it self, are these: First, for Protection; which, besides
what they give one to another, they afford also to the _Flower_ and
_Fruit_. To the _Flower_ in their _Foulds_; that being, for the most
part, born and usher’d into the open Aer by the _Leaves_. To the
_Fruit_, when afterwards they are display’d, as in _Strawberries_,
_Grapes_, _Rasps_, _Mulberries_, &c. On which, and the like, should the
Sun-Beams immediately strike, especially while they are young, they
would quite shrivel them up; but being by the _Leaves_ screened off,
they impress the circumjacent _Aer_ so far only as gently to warm the
said _Fruits_, and so to promote their _Fermentation_ and _Growth_. And
accordingly we see, that the _Leaves_ above-named are exceeding large
in proportion to the _Fruits_: whereas in _Pear-trees_, _Apple-trees_,
&c. the _Fruit_ being of a solider _Parenchyma_, and so not needing the
like protection, are usually equal with, and often wider in Diameter
than the _Leaves_.

19. §. Another use is for Augmentation; or, the capacity for the
due spreading and ampliation of a _Tree_ or other _Plant_, are
its _Leaves_. For herein the _Lignous Body_ being divided into
small _Fibres_, and these running all along their lax and spongie
_Parenchyma_; they are thus a _Body_ fit for the imbibition of _Sap_,
and easie _Growth_. Now the _Sap_ having a free reception into the
_Leaves_, it still gives way to the next succeeding in the _Branches_
and _Trunk_, and the voyding of the _Sap_ in these, for the mounting
of that in the _Root_, and ingress of that in the _Ground_. But were
there no _Leaves_ to make a free reception of _Sap_, it must be needs
be stagnant in all the _Parts_ to the _Root_, and so the _Root_ being
clogg’d, its fermenting and other Offices will be voyded, and so the
due _Growth_ of the whole. As in the motion of a _Watch_, although
the original term thereof be the _Spring_, yet, the capacity for its
continuance in a due measure throughout all the _Wheels_, is the free
and easie motion of the _Ballance_.

20. §. Lastly, As the _Leaves_ subserve the more copious advancement,
so the higher purity of the _Sap_. For this being well fermented both
in the _Root_, and in its Ascent through the _Trunk_, and so its
_Parts_ prepar’d to a farther separation; the grosser ones are still
deposited into the _Leaves_; the more elaborate and essential only
thus supplied to the _Flower_, _Fruit_ and _Seed_, as their convenient
_Aliment_. Whence it is, that where the _Flowers_ are many and large,
into which the more odorous _Particles_ are copiously receiv’d, the
green _Leaves_ have little or no smell; as those of _Rose-tree_,
_Carnations_, _French-Marigold_, _Wood-bind_, _Tulips_, &c. But on the
contrary, where the _Flowers_ are none, or small, the green _Leaves_
themselve are likewise of a strong savour; as those of _Wormwood_,
_Tansie_, _Baum_, _Mint_, _Rue_, _Geranium Moschatum_, _Angelica_, and
others.




                             _An Appendix._

                    _Of Thorns, Hairs and Globulets._


_THorns_ are of two kinds, _Lignous_ and _Cortical_. Of the first
are such as those of the _Hawthorn_, and are constituted of all the
same substantial _Parts_ whereof the _Germen_ or _Bud_ it self, and
in a like proportion: which also in their Infancy are set with the
resemblances of divers minute _Leaves_. Of affinity with these are
the _Spinets_ or _Thorny Prickles_ upon the Edges and Tops of divers
_Leaves_, as of _Barbery_, _Holly_, _Thistle_, _Furze_, and others; all
which I think are the filamentous extremities of the _Lignous Body_
sheathed in the _Skin_. But this principal difference betwixt a _Bud_
and these _Lignous Thorns_, is observable; That the _Bud_ hath its
Original from the Inner part of the _Lignous Body_, next the _Pith_:
But these _Thorns_, from the outer, and less fecund Part; and so
produceth no _Leaves_, but is, as it were, the _Mola_ of a _Bud_.

2. §. _Cortical Thorns_ are such as those of the _Rasberry_ Bush, being
not, unless in a most extraordinary small and invisible proportion
propagated from the _Lignous Body_, but as, it seems, wholly from the
_Cortical_ and _Skin_, or from the exteriour part of the _Barque_.

3. §. The _Growth_ of this _Thorn_ may farther argue
what in the ♦ _C. 2. §. 25._ ♦ _Second Chapter_ we supposed; _sc._
That as the proper _Tendency_ of the _Lignous Body_, is to _Ascend_;
so of the _Cortical_ to _Descend_. For as the _Lignous Thorn_, like
other _Parts_ of the _Trunk_, in its _Growth_ ascends; This, being
almost wholly _Cortical_, pointeth downward. ♦ Hist. of the _Prop._
of _Veget._ ♦ The use of _Thorns_ the Ingenious Mr. _Sharrock_
hath observed.

4. §. Upon the _Leaves_ of divers _Plants_ two _Productions_ shew
themselves, _sc._ _Hairs_ and _Gloubulets_. Of _Hairs_, only one kind
is taken notice of; although they are various. Ordinarily they are of
a _Simple Figure_; which when fine and thick set, as on most _Hairy
Buds_; or fine and long, as on those of the _Vine_, we call them _Down_.

5. §. But sometimes they are _Branched out_, from the bottom to the
top, reciprocally on every side, in some resemblance to a _Stags Horn_;
as in _Mullen_. And sometimes they are _Astral_, as upon _Lavender_,
and some other _Leaves_, and especially those of _Wild Olive_; wherein
every _Hair_ rising in one round entire _Basis_ a little way above the
surface of the _Leaf_, is then disparted, Star-like, into several,
four, five or six _Points_, all standing at right Angles with the said
perpendicular _Basts_.

6. §. The Uses of _Hairs_ are for _Distinction_ and _Protection_.
That of _Distinction_ is but secondary, the _Leaves_ being grown to
a considerable size. That of _Protection_ is the prime, for which
they were originally form’d together with the _Leaves_ themselves,
and whose service they enjoy in their Infant-estate: For the _Hairs_
being then in form of a _Down_, always very thick set, thus, give that
_Protection_ to the _Leaves_, which their exceeding tenderness then
requires; so that they seem to be veiled with a Coat of _Frize_, or to
be kept warm, like young and dainty _Chickens_, in _Wool_.

7. §. _Globulets_ are seen upon _Orach_, both Garden and Wild; and yet
more plainly on _Mercury_ or _Bonus Henricus_. In these, growing almost
upon the whole _Plant_, and being very large, they are by all taken
notice of.

8. §. But strict Observation discovers, that these _Globulets_ are the
natural and constant Off-spring of very many other _Plants_. Both these
_Globulets_, and likewise the diversity of _Hairs_, I find that Mr.
_Hook_ hath also observed. ♦ Micrography. ♦I take notice, that they are
of two kinds; _Transparent_, as upon the _Leaves_ of _Hysop_, _Mint_,
_Baume_, and many more _White_, as upon those of _Germander_, _Sage_,
and others. All which, though the naked Eye will discover, yet by the
help of _Glasses_ we may observe them most distinctly. The use of these
we suppose the same, in part, with those of the _Flower_, whereof we
shall speak.




                                CHAP. V.

                            _Of the FLOWER._


WE next proceed to the _Flower_. The general _Parts_ whereof are most
commonly three; _sc._ the _Empalement_, the _Foliation_, and the
_Attire_.

2. §. The _Empalement_, whether of one or more pieces, I call
that which is the utmost _Part_ of the _Flower_, encompassing
the other two. ’Tis compounded of the three general _Parts_, the
_Skin_, the _Cortical_ and _Lignous Bodies_, each _Empaler_ (where
there are divers) being as another little _Leaf_; as in those of a
_Quince-Flower_, as oft as they happen to be overgrown, is well seen.
As likewise in the _Primrose_, with the _green Flower_; commonly so
call’d, though by a mistake: For that which seems to be the _Flower_,
is only the more flourishing _Empalement_, the _Flower_ it self being
_White_. But the continuation of all the three aforesaid _Parts_ into
each _Empaler_, is discoverable, I think, no where better than in an
_Artichoke_, which is a true _Flower_, and whose _Empalers_ are of
that amplitude, as fairly to shew them all: As also, that the Original
of the _Skin_ of each _Empaler_ or _Leaf_ is not distinct from that
of the rest; but to be all one piece, laid in so many _Plaits_ or
_Duplicatures_, as there are _Leaves_, from the outermost to the inner
and most Central ones.

3. §. The Design of the _Empalement_, is to be _Security_ and _Bands_
to the other two _Parts_ of the _Flower_: To be their _Security_ before
its opening, by intercepting all extremities of _Weather_: Afterwards
to be their _Bands_, and firmly to contain all their _Parts_ in
their due and most decorous posture: so that a _Flower_ without its
_Empalement_, would hang as uncouth and taudry, as a _Lady_ without her
_Bodies_.

4. §. Hence we have the reason why it is various, and sometimes
wanting. Some _Flowers_ have none, as _Tulips_; for having a fat and
firm _Leaf_, and each _Leaf_ likewise standing on a broad and strong
_Basis_, they are thus sufficient to themselves. _Carnations_, on the
contrary, have not only an _Empalement_, but that (for more firmitude)
of one piece: For otherwise, the Foot of each _Leaf_ being very long
and slender, most of them would be apt to break out of compass: yet
is the top of the _Empalement_ indented also; that the _Indentments_,
by being lapp’d over the _Leaves_ before their expansion, may then
protect them; and by being spread under them afterwards, may better
shoulder and prop them up. And if the Feet of the _Leaves_ be both
long and very tender too, here the _Empalement_ is numerous, though
consisting of several pieces; yet those in divers _Rounds_, and all
with a counterchangeable respect to each other (which also the Learned
Sir _Thomas Brown_ observes) ♦ Treat. of the _Quincunx_. ♦ as in all
_Knapweeds_, and other _Flowers_; whereby, how commodious they are
for both the aforesaid ends, may easily be conceiv’d; and well enough
exemplified by the Scales of _Fishes_, whereunto, as to their position,
they have not an unapt resemblance.


5. §. THE FOLIATION also, is of the same substantial _Nature_ with the
green _Leaf_; the _Membrane_, _Pulp_, and _Fibres_ whereof, being, as
there, so here, but the continuation of the _Skin_, the _Cortical_ and
_Lignous Bodies_.

6. §. The _Foulds_ of the _Flower_ or _Foliation_ are various, as those
of the green _Leaf_; but some of them different. The most general
are, First, The _Close-Couch_, as in _Roses_, and many other double
_Flowers_. Then the _Concave-Couch_, as in _Blattaria flore albo_.
Next the _Plait_, as in some of the _Leaves_ of _Pease-Blooms_, in
the _Flowers_ of _Coriander_, &c. which is either single, as in those
nam’d; or double, as in _Blew-Bottle_, _Jacea_, and more of that rank.
Next, the _Couch_, and _Plait_ together in the same _Flower_, as in
_Marigolds_, _Daisies_, and all others of an agreeing form: where the
first apparent _Fould_ or _Composture_ of the _Leaves_ is in _Couch_;
but the _Leaves_ being erect, each likewise may be seen to lie in a
double _Plait_ within it self. Then the _Rowl_, as in the _Flowers_ of
_Ladies-Bower_, the broad top of each _Leaf_ being by a double _Rowl_
foulded up inwardly. Next, the _Spire_, which is the beginning of a
_Rowl_; and may be seen in the _Flowers_ of _Mallows_, and others.
Lastly, the _Plait_ and _Spire_ together, where the _Part_ analogous
to the _Foliation_, is of one piece, the _Plaits_ being here laid, and
so carried on by _Spiral Lines_ to the top of the _Flower_, as is in
divers, and I think, in _Convolvulus Doronici folio_, more elegantly
seen. These and other _Foulds_, See in the _Figures_ belonging to
the _Second_ =Part= of the _Fourth_ =Book=. The reason of all which
varieties, a comparative consideration of the several _Parts_ of the
_Flower_ may suggest. I’le only mention, That no _Flower_, that I
find, hath a _Back-Rowl_, as hath the green _Leaf_. For two Reasons;
because its _Leaves_ have not their _Fibres_ standing out much on their
backside, as the green _Leaves_ have; and because of its _Attire_,
which it ever embosomes, and cannot so well do it by a _Back-Rowl_.

7. §. The usual _Protections_ of _Flowers_ by the Precedents are
express’d, _sc._ _Green Leaves_ and _Empalements_. Some have another
more peculiar, that is a _double Veil_; as the _Spring-Crocus_. For
having no _Empalement_, and starting up early out of the _Mould_, even
before its _Green Leaves_, and that upon the first opening of the
Spring; lest it should thus be quite starved, ’tis born swath’d up in a
double _Blanket_, or with a pair of _Sheets_ upon its _Back_.

8. §. The _Leaves_ of divers _Flowers_ at their _Basis_ have an _hairy
Tuft_; by which _Tufts_ the Concave of the _Empalement_ is filled up;
That, being very choice and tender, they may thus be kept in a gentle
and constant Warmth, as most convenient for them.

9. §. The _Leaves_ of the _Flower_, though they are not hairy all
over, yet in some particular parts they are often set with a fine
Downy _Velvet_; that, being by their shape and posture in those parts
contiguous to their delicate and tender _Attire_, they may thus give it
a more soft and warmer touch. Thus in the _Flower_ of _Ladies Bower_,
those parts of its _Leaves_ which rowl inward, and lie contiguous to
the _Attire_, are Downy; whereas the other _Parts_ are smooth or bald:
So the _Flowers_ of _Pease_, _Spanish Broom_, _Toad-Flax_, and many
others, where contiguous to their _Attires_, are deck’d with the like
_Hairy Velvet_.

10. §. As upon the Green _Leaves_, so upon the _Flowers_ are
_Globulets_ somtimes seen; as upon the backside of that of _Enula_.
On none more plainly than that kind of _Blattaria_ with the white
_Flower_; where they are all transparent, and growing both on the
_Stalk_ and _Leaves_ of the _Flower_, each shewing likewise its
_Peduncle_ whereon it is erected.

11. §. The use of the _Flower_, or the _Foliation_ whereof we now
speak, (that is, as to its private service) is for the protection of
the _Attire_; _This_, as its under, and the _Empalement_ as its upper
Garments. As likewise of the _Fruit_: The necessity of which Service,
in some Cases, by the different situation of the _Flower_ and _Fruit_,
with respect to each other, is evident; _Apples_, _Pears_, and several
other _Fruits_, standing behind or under the _Flower_; but _Cherries_,
_Aprecots_, and divers others, within it. For these, being of a very
tender and pulpous Body, and withal putting forth with the colder part
of the Spring; could not weather it out against the Variations and
Extremities of the Air, (as those of a more solid _Parenchyma_ can)
except lodged up within their _Flowers_.

12. §. And as the _Flower_ is serviceable to the safety of the _Fruit_,
so is it to its growth; _sc._ in its Infancy, or _Embryo_-estate; for
which purpose, as there is a _Flower_, so that _Flower_ is greater or
less, according as the nature of the _Fruit_ to which it belongs, and
the plenty of the _Sap_ by which the _Fruit_ is fed, doth require.
Thus, where the young _Fruit_ is of a solider Substance and the ascent
of the _Sap_ less copious, were there here no _Flower_ to promote the
said ascent thereof into the _Fruit_ (in the manner as is effected by
the Green _Leaves_) it must needs pine and die, or prove less kindly.
On the contrary, should the _Flower_ be over-large, it would not only
promote the ascent of the _Sap_ up to the _Fruit_, but being as yet
over-proportionate to it, would likewise it self exhaust the same
_Sap_, as fast as ascendent; like a greedy Nurse, that prepares the
Meat for her Child, and then eats it up her self. Thus we see _Apples_
and _Pears_, with a _Flower_ of a moderate _Size_; like their _Body_,
of a middle Constitution, and their _Sap_, of a middle quantity:
But _Quinces_, being more solid, besides that they have as great a
_Flower_, the _Impalers_ of their _Flower_ also thrive so far as to
become handsom _Leaves_; continuing also after the _Flower_ is fallen,
firm and verdent a great while; so long, till the _Fruit_ be able to
provide for it self. On the other hand, _Plums_ being more tender and
Sappy than _Apples_ and _Pears_, besides that their _Empalers_ are much
alike, their _Flower_ is less, and _Goosberries_ and _Currants_, which
are still more Pulpy, and the course of the _Sap_ towards them more
free, have yet a _Flower_ far less. And _Grapes_, whose _Sap_ is still
of quicker Ascent, have scarce any _Flower_ at all; only some small
resemblance thereof, serving just upon the setting of the _Fruit_, and
no longer.


13. §. THE ATTIRE, I find to be of two kinds, _Seminiforme_, and
_Florid_. That which I call _Seminiforme_, is made up of two general
_Parts_, _Chives_ and _Semets_, one upon each _Chive_. These _Semets_
(as I take leave to call them) have the appearance, especially in many
_Flowers_, of so many little _Seeds_: but are quite another kind of
_Body_. For, upon enquiry, we find, that these _Semets_, though they
seem to be solid, and for some time after their first formation, are
entire; yet are they really hollow; and their side, or sides, which
were at first entire, at length crack asunder: And that moreover the
_Concave_ of each _Semet_ is not a meer vacuity, but fill’d up with a
number of minute Particles, in form of a _Powder_. Which, though common
to all _Semets_, yet in some, and particularly those of a _Tulip_ or
a _Lilly_, being larger, is more distinctly observable. ♦ _Tab. 4. f.
12._ ♦

14. §. These _Semets_ are somtimes fastned so, as to stand erect above
their _Chive_, as those of _Larks-heel_. Somtimes, and I think usually,
so as to hang a little down by the midle, in the manner and figure of
a _Kidney_; as in _Mallows_. Their _Cleft_ or _Crack_ is sometimes
single, but for the most part double: At these _Clefts_ it is that they
disburse their _Powders_; ♦ _f. 12._ a. ♦ which as they start out, and
stand betwixt the two Lips of each _Cleft_, have some resemblance to
the common Sculpture of a _Pomegranate_ with its _Seeds_ looking out at
the _Cleft_ of its _Rind_. This must be observ’d when the _Clefts_ are
recently made, which usually is before the expansion of the _Flower_.

15. §. The Particles of these _Powders_, though like those of Meal or
other Dust, they appear not easily to have any regular shape; yet upon
strict observation, especially with the assistance of an indifferent
_Glass_, it doth appear, That they are a _Congeries_, usually, of so
many perfect _Globes_ or _Globulets_; Sometimes of other _Figures_, but
always regular. That which obscures their _Figure_ is their being so
small: In _Dogs-Mercury_, _Borage_, and very many more _Plants_, they
are extreamly so. In _Mallows_, and some others, more fairly visible.

16. §. Some of these _Powders_, are _yellow_, as in _Dogs-Mercury_,
_Goats-Rue_, &c. and some of other Colours: But most of them I think
are _white_; and those of _yellow Henbane_ very elegant; the disburs’d
_Powders_ whereof, to the naked eye, are _white_ as _Snow_; but each
_Globulet_, through a Glass, transparent as Crystal; which is not a
fallacy from the _Glass_, but what we see in all transparent _Bodies_
whatsoever, lying in a _Powder_ or small Particles together. The Parts
of this _Attire_, see in _Tab. 4._ But especially, in the _Figures_
belonging to the _Second_ =Part= of the _Fourth_ =Book=.

17. §. The _Florid Attire_, is commonly known by the blind and rude
Name of _Thrums_; as in the _Flowers_ of _Marigold_, _Tansie_, &c.
How inadequate its imposition is, observation will determine. For the
several _Thrums_ or rather _Suits_, whereof the _Attire_ is made up,
however else they may differ in various _Flowers_, in this agree, that
they are ever consistent of more than one, sometimes of Two, ♦ _Tab. 4.
f. 13._ a. ♦ and for the most part of Three _Pieces_ (for which I call
them _Suits_) and each _Piece_ of a different, but agreeable and comely
form.

18. §. The _outer Part_ of every _Suit_, is its _Floret_: whose _Body_
or _Tube_ is divided at the top (like that of the _Cowslip_) into
five distinct _Leaves_. ♦ _f. 13._ b. ♦ So that a _Floret_, is the
Epitome of a _Flower_: and is all the _Flower_ that many _Plants_, as
_Mugwort_, _Tansie_, and others, have. What the Learned Sir _Thomas
Brown_ observeth ♦ Treat. of the _Quincunx_. ♦ of the number _Five_, as
to the _Leaves_ of the _Flower_, is still more universally holding in
these of the _Floret_.

19. §. Upon the Expansion of the _Floret_, the next _Part_ of the
_Suit_ is from within its _Tube_ brought to sight; which we may (with
respect to that within it) call the _Sheath_. ♦ _f. 13._ c. ♦ For this
also, like the _Floret_, is a _Concave Body_; in its shape very well
resembling the Fistulous Pouches of _Wake-Robin_, or of _Dragon_.

20. §. The _Sheath_, after some time, dividing at the top, from within
its Concave the Third and innermost part of the _Suit_, _sc._ the
_Blade_ advanceth and displayes it self. ♦ _Tab. 4. f. 13._ d. ♦ This
Part is not hollow, as the other two, but solid; yet at its Point, is
commonly, divided into two halves.

21. §. About the said Point especially, there appears, _Globulets_,
which are of the same nature with those of a _Semet_, though not so
copious. So that all _Flowers_ have their _Powders_ or _Globulets_. The
whole _Attire_ may in _Aster Per_, _Blewbottle_, &c. where the _Suits_
are large, be plainly observed without a _Glass_. The _Parts_ of this
_Attire_, See in _Tab. 4._ But especially in the _Figures_ belonging to
the _Second_ =Part= of the _Fourth_ =Book=.

22. §. The use of the _Attire_, how contemptibly soever we may look
upon it, is certainly great. And though for our own use we value
the _Leaves_ of the _Flower_, or the _Foliation_, most; yet of all
the three _Parts_, this in some respects is the choycest, as for
whose sake and service the other two are made. The use hereof, as to
_Ornament_ and _Distinction_, is unquestionable; but is not all. As for
Distinction, though, by the help of _Glasses_, we may make it to extend
far; yet in a passant view, which is all we usually make, we cannot so
well. As for Ornament, and particularly in reference to the _Semets_,
we may ask, If for that meerly these were meant, then why should they
be so made as to break open, or to contain any thing within them? Since
their Beauty would be as good if they were not hollow; and is better
before they crack and burst open, than afterwards.

23. §. Other uses hereof therefore we must acknowledge, and may
observe. One is, for food; for Ornament and Distinction to us, and for
_Food_ to other _Animals_. I will not say, but that it may serve even
to these for Distinction too, that they may be able to know one _Plant_
from another, and in their flight or progress settle where they like
best: and that therefore the varieties of these small parts are many,
and well observed by them, which we take no notice of. Yet the finding
out of Food is but in order to enjoy it: Which, that it is provided for
a vast number of little _Animals_ in the _Attires_ of all _Flowers_,
observation perswades us to believe. For why else are they evermore
here found? Go from one _Flower_ to another, great and small, you shall
meet with none untaken up with these Guests. In some, and particularly
the _Sun-Flower_, where the parts of the _Attire_, and the _Animals_
for which they provide, are larger, the matter is more visible. We must
not think, that _God Almighty_ hath left any of the whole Family of
his Creatures unprovided for; but as the Great Master, some where or
other carveth out to all; and that for a great number of these little
Folk, He hath stored up their peculiar provisions in the _Attires_
of _Flowers_; each _Flower_ thus becoming their Lodging and their
Dining-Room, both in one.

24. §. Wherein the particular parts of the _Attire_ may be more
distinctly serviceable, this to one _Animal_, and that to another, I
cannot say: Or to the same _Animal_, as a _Bee_, whether this for the
_Honey_, another for their _Bread_, a third for the _Wax_: Or whether
all only suck from hence some _Juice_; or some may not also carry some
of the _Parts_, as of the _Globulets_, wholly away.

25. §. Or lastly, what may be the Primary and Private Use of the
_Attire_ (for even this abovesaid, though great, yet is but Secondary)
I now determine not.




                                CHAP. VI.

                             _Of the FRUIT._


THE general composition of all _Fruits_ is one, that is, their
_Essential_ and truly _Vital Parts_, are in all the same, and but the
continuation of those which in the other _Parts_ of a _Plant_, we have
already observed. Yet because by the different _Constitutions_ and
_Tinctures_ of these _Parts_, divers considerably different _Fruits_
result; I shall therefore take a particular view of the more known
and principal of them, _sc._ _Apples_, _Pears_, _Plums_, _Nuts_ and
_Berries_.


2. §. AN APPLE, if cut traverse, appears constituted of four distinct
_Parts_, the _Pilling_, the _Parenchyma_, _Branchery_, and _Coare_.
The _Pilling_ is only the spreading and dilatation of the _Skin_,
or utmost part of the _Barque_ in the _Branch_. The _Parenchyma_,
when full ripe, is a tender delicate Meat. Yet as the _Pilling_ is
but the Continuation of the utmost part of the _Barque_; so is this,
but the continuance and ampliation, or (as I may call it) the swelth
and superbience of the _Inner Part_ thereof; which upon observation
of a young and Infant-_Apple_ especially, is evident. Thus we see
the _Pith_, which is often tough; in many _Roots_, as _Parsneps_,
_Turneps_, &c. is tender and edible. So here, the _Parenchyma_, though
originally no more than the _Barque_, yet the copiousness and purity
of its _Sap_ being likewise effectual to the largness and fineness of
its growth, it thus becomes a soft and tender meat. The _Branchery_ is
nothing else but the Ramifications of the _Lignous Body_ throughout all
the parts of the _Parenchyma_; the greater _Branches_ being likewise
by the _Inosculations_ of the less (as in the _Leaf_) united together.
The main _Branches_ are usually Twenty: Ten are spred and distributed
through the _Parenchyma_, most of them enarching themselves towards
the _Cork_ or _Stool_ of the _Flower_: The other Ten, running from
the _Stalk_ in a directer Line, at last meet the former at the said
_Cork_, and are there osculated with them. Of these latter, five are
originated from one; which running along the Center of the _Stalk_, and
part of the _Parenchyma_ of the _Fruit_, is therein at last divided.
To these the Coats of the _Kernels_ are fastned. So that whereas
most of these _Branches_ were originally extended even beyond the
_Fruit_, and inserted into the _Flower_ for the due growth thereof;
the _Fruit_ afterwards growing to some head, and so intercepting and
preying upon the _Aliment_ of the _Flower_, starves that and therefrom
supersedes the service of the said _Branches_ to it self, fifteen for
its _Parenchyma_, and five for its _Seed_. The _Coar_ is originated
from the _Pith_; for the _Sap_ finding room enough in the _Parenchyma_,
through which to dispence it self all abroad, quits the _Pith_, which
thereby hardens into a _Coar_. Thus we see the _Insertions_, although
originate from the _Cortical Body_, yet their _Parts_ being, by the
_Inosculations_ of the _Lignous_, so much compress’d and made to
co-incide together, they become a _Body_ very compact and dense. And
in the _Barque_ the same thing is effected by _Arefaction_ only, or a
meer _voydance_ of the _Sap_; the _Inner Part_ whereof, though soft
and sappy, yet its superficial _Rind_ is often so hard and smooth,
that it may be fairly writ upon. The _Parts_ of an _Apple_, See in the
_Figures_ belonging to the _Third_ =Part= of the _Fourth_ =Book=.


3. §. IN A PEAR there are five distinct _Parts_, the _Pilling_, the
_Parenchyma_, _Branchery_, _Calculary_, and _Acetary_. ♦ _Tab. 4. f.
14._ ♦ The three former are here and in an _Apple_ much alike; saving
that here the _Inner_ or _Seed-Branches_ ordinarily stand double.
The _Calculary_ (most observable in rough-tasted, or _Choak-Pears_)
is a _Congeries_ of little stony _Knots_. They are many of them
dispersed throughout the whole _Parenchyma_: But lying more continuous
and compact together towards the Center of the _Pear_, surround the
_Acetary_ there, in a somewhat Globular Form. About the _Stalk_
they stand more distant; but towards the _Cork_ or _Stool_ of the
_Flower_, they still grow closer, and there at last gather (almost)
into the firmitude of a _Plum-stone_ it self. Within this lies the
_Acetary_; ’tis allways sour, and by the bounding of the _Calculary_
of a _Globular Figure_. ’Tis a simple _Body_, having neither any of
the _Lignous_ branched in it, nor any _Calculous Knots_. It is of the
same substantial nature with the outer _Parenchyma_; but whether it be
absolutely one with it, or be derived immediately from the _Pith_, my
Enquiries yet made, determine not.

4. §. The Original of the _Calculary_ I seem to have neglected. But
hereof we may here best say, that whereas all the other _Parts_
are _Essential_ and truly _Vital_; the _Calculary_ is not: but
that the several _Knots_ whereof it consists, are only so many
meer _Concretions_ or _Precipitations_ out of the _Sap_; as in
_Urines_, _Wines_, and other _Liquors_, we often see. And that the
_Precipitation_ is made by the mixture and re-action of the _Tinctures_
of the _Lignous_ and _Cortical Bodies_ upon each other: Even as all
_Vegetable Nutrition_ or _Fixation_ of _Parts_ is also made by the
joynt efficiency of the two same _Tinctures_, as hath been said. Hence
we find, that as the _Acetary_ hath no _Branches_ of the _Lignous
Body_, so neither hath it any _Knots_. Hence likewise it is, that we
have so different and contrary a tast in the _Parenchyma_ beyond the
_Calculary_, from that in the _Acetary_: For whereas this is sour,
that, wherein the said _Precipitations_ are made, is sweet; being much
alike effect to what we find in mixing of _Corals_, &c. with _Vinegar_
or other _acid Liquors_. The _Parts_ of a _Pear_, See in _Tab. 4._ But
especially in the _Figures_ belonging to the _Third_ =Part= of the
_Fourth_ =Book=.


5. §. IN A PLUM (to which the _Cherry_, _Apricot_, _Peach_, _Walnut_,
&c. ought to be referr’d) there are four distinct _Parts_, the
_Pilling_, the _Parenchyma_, _Branchery_ and _Stone_. The _Pilling_
and _Parenchyma_ are, as to their Original, with those of an
_Apple_ or _Pear_, both alike. As likewise the _Branchery_; but
differently ramified. In _Plums_ (I suppose all) there are five main
_Out-Branches_, which run along the Surface of the _Stone_ from the
_Basis_ to the point thereof, four of them by one _Ridge_, and one by
the other opposite to it. ♦ _Tab. 4. f. 15._ ♦ In an _Apricot_ there is
the same number, but the single _Branch_ runs not upon the _Surface_,
but through the _Body_ of the _Stone_. There are likewise two or three
smaller _Branches_, which run in like manner under the other _Ridge_
for some space, and then advancing into the _Parenchyma_, therein
disperse themselves: These latter sort in _Peaches_ are numerous
throughout.

6. §. But notwithstanding the different disposition of the _Branches_
of the _Fruits_ aforesaid; yet is there one _Branch_ dispos’d in one
and the same manner in them all. The entrance hereof into the _Stone_
is at its _Basis_; from whence running through its Body, and still
inclining or arching it self towards its _Concave_, is at last, about
its _Cone_, thereinto emergent, ♦ _Tab. 4. f. 15._ ♦ where the _Coats_
of the _Seed_ are appendent to it. Of the _Seed-Branch_ ’tis therefore
observable that after its entrance into the _Fruit_, ’tis always
prolonged therein to a considerable length; as is seen not only in
_Apples_, &c. where the _Seed_ stands a good distance from the _Stalk_;
but in _Plums_ likewise, where it stands very near it; in that here the
_Seed-Branch_, as is said, never strikes through the _Stone_ into the
_Coats_ of the _Seed_ directly, but runs through a _Chanel_ cut in the
_Stone_, till it issues, near the _Cone_, into the _Concave_ thereof.

7. §. The _Stone_ though it seem a simple Body, yet it is compounded
of different ones. The Inner _Part_ thereof, as it is by far the
thinnest, so is it the most _dense_, _white_, _smooth_ and _simple_.
The Original is from the _Pith_; difficult, but curious to observe:
For the _Seed-Branch_, not striking directly and immediately quite
through the _Basis_ of the _Stone_, but in the manner as is above
described, carries a considerable _Part_ of the _Pith_, now gather’d
round about it, as its _Parenchyma_, along with it self; which upon
its entrance into the concave of the _Stone_ about its farther
end, is there in part spread all over it, as the _Lining_ thereof.
The outer and very much thicker _Part_, consisteth partly of the
like _Precipitations_ or concrete Particles, as in a _Pear_; being
gathered here much more closely, not only to a _Contiguity_, but a
_Coalition_ into one entire _Stone_; as we see in _Pears_ themselves,
especially towards the _Cork_, they gather into the like Stoniness;
or as a _Stone_, _Mineral_, or _Animal_, is oftentimes the product
of accumulated _Gravel_. But as the _Parenchyma_ is mixed with the
_Concretions_ in the _Calculary_, so is it also, though not visibly,
with these in the _Stone_, the _ground_ of the _Stone_ being indeed a
perfect _Parenchyma_; but by the said _Concretions_ so far alter’d,
as to become dry, hard and undistinguishable from them. All which
Particulars, are observable only in the several degrees of _Growth_ in
the young _Fruit_. And are represented in _Tab. 4._ But especially by
the several _Figures_ belonging to the _Third_ and _Fourth_ =Parts= of
the _Fourth_ =Book=.


8. §. IN A NUT (to which an _Akern_ is analogous) there are three
general _Parts_, the _Cap_, _Shell_, and _Pith_. The _Cap_ is
constituted of a _Pilling_ and _Parenchyma_, derived from the _Barque_;
and _Ramulets_ from the _Lignous Body_ of the _Branch_. The _Shell_
likewise is not one simple Body, but compounded. The Superficial _Part_
thereof is originated from the _Pilling_ or _Skin_ of the _Cap_, from
the inside whereof it is, in a Duplicature, produc’d and spred over
the _Shell_. Which, if you look at the _Basis_ of the _Shell_, is
farther evident: for that being continuous with the _Parenchyma_ of
the _Cap_, without the interposure of the _Skin_, the said superficial
_Part_ is there wanting. The thicker and inner _Part_ of the _Shell_
consisteth of the same _Parenchyma_ as that of the _Cap_, with a
_Congeries_ of _Precipitations_ silled up, as in a _Stone_. And as the
_Lignous Body_ is branched in a _Stone_, so, with some difference,
in a _Shell_. The _outer Branches_ or _Ramulets_ are numerous, each
issuing out of the _Parenchyma_ of the _Cap_, and entring the _Shell_
at the _Circumference_ of its _Basis_, and so running betwixt its
superficial and inner _Parts_ towards the _Cone_, round about. The
_Inner_ or _Seed-Branch_ is single, entring in, as do the other, at
the _Basis_ of the _Shell_, but at the _Center_ thereof: from whence
it runs, not through the _Shell_, as in _Plums_ through the _Stone_;
but through the _Pith_, as far as the _Cone_, where the _Coats_ of the
_Seed_ hang appendent to it. The _Pith_ whether derived from the same
part both in name and nature in the _Branch_ and _Stalk_; or from the
_Cortical Body_, I yet determine not. The _Parts_ of a _Nut_, See in
the _Figures_ belonging to the _Third_ =Part= of the _Fourth_ =Book=.


9. §. A BERRY, as a _Gooseberry_ (to which _Corinths_, _Grapes Hips_,
&c. are to be referr’d) consisteth, besides the _Seed_, of the three
general _Parts_, _Pilling_, _Parenchyma_ and _Branchery_. The _Pilling_
is originated as in the foregoing _Fruits_. The _Parenchyma_ is double,
as likewise in some other _Berries_. The _outer_ is commonly, together
with the _Pilling_, call’d the _Skin_, and is that part we spit out,
being of a sour tast. Now as the _Pilling_ is originated from the
_outer_, so this from the _inner Part_ of the _Barque_; and accordingly
the _Pores_ thereof may be observed plainly of a like shape with those
both of the _Cortical Body_ and _Pith_. The _Inner_ or _Pulp_ is of a
sweet taste, and is the _Part_ we eat: It is of a Substance so laxe
and tender, as it would seem to be only a thicker or jellied _Juice_;
although this likewise be a true _Parenchyma_, something like that of
an _Orange_ or _Limon_, with its _Pores_ all fill’d up with _Liquor_.
The _Branchery_ is likewise double: The _Exterior_ runs betwixt the
_Pilling_ and _Outer Parenchyma_ in arched _Lines_, from the _Stalk_ to
the _Stool_ of the _Flower_. These _outer Branches_, though of various
number at the _Stalk_, yet at the _Cork_ are usually ten principal
ones; five for the five _Leaves_ of the _Flower_, and five for the
_Attire_. The _Inner main Branches_ are two, diametrically opposite to
each other, and at the _Cork_ with the other inosculated. From these
two are branched other smaller, every one having a _Seed_ appendent
to it, whose _Coats_ it entreth by a double _Filament_, one at the
_Basis_, the other at the _Cone_. They are all very white and turgent,
and by a slaunt cut, may be observ’d concave; thus representing
themselves analogous to so many true _spermatick Vessels_. The _Parts_
of a _Gooseberry_, See in the _Figures_ belonging to the _Third_ =Part=
of the _Fourth_ =Book=.

10. §. The Uses of _Fruits_ are for _Man_, (sometimes also other
_Animals_, as are _Akerns_ and _Haws_) and for the _Seed_. For
_Man_, they are so variously desirable, that till our _Orchards_ and
_Store-Chambers_, _Confectioners-Stoves_ and _Apothecaries-Shops_,
our _Ladies Closets_, their _Tables_ or _Hands_ are empty of them, I
shall not need to enquire for what. If it be asked, how the _Fruit_
becomes, generally above all the other _Parts_, so pleasant a Meat? It
is partly from the _Sap_, the grosser portion thereof being deposited
in the _Leaves_, and so the purer hereunto reserved. Partly from the
_Globular Figure_ of the _Fruit_. For the _Sap_ being thus in a greater
quantity herein, and in all Parts equally diffus’d, the _Concoction_
hereof, as in a _Vessel_, is with greatest advantage favoured and
promoted. Wherefore all _Fruits_, which we eat raw, how small soever,
are of a _Globular_ Form, or thereunto approaching; and the nearer,
the delicater; amongst _Apples_, the _Pipin_; amongst _Pears_, the
_Burgundian_; and amongst all _Fruits_, the _Grape_; and amongst
_Grapes_, the roundest, are of all, the most dainty.

11. §. The visible cause of this _Globular Figure_, is the _Flower_;
or the Inosculation of all the main _Branches_ at the _Stool_ of the
_Flower_; and upon the fall of the _Flower_, the obtuseness, and with
_Wind_ and _Sun_, as it were the _seaing_ of their several ends: For
thus the _Sap_ entering the _Fruit_, being not able to effect, either
a _Disunion_, or a _shooting_ forth of the said _Branches_, and so to
carry on their _Growth_ in length; they must of necessity be enarch’d,
and with the _Parenchyma_ more and more expand themselves. Whereas
were they disposed and qualified otherwise, than as is said; instead
of forming a _Fruit_ within bounds, they would run out into all
extravagance, and even into another little _Tree_ or _Leafy Growth_.

12. §. To the _Seed_, the _Fruit_ is serviceable; First, in order to
its being supply’d with a due and most convenient _Sap_, the greater
part thereof, and that which is less elaborated, being, in its passage
towards the _Seed_, thereinto received; the _Fruit_ doing the same
office to the _Seed_, which the _Leaves_ do to the _Fruit_; the _Sap_
in the _Fruit_ being, in a laxe comparison, as the _Wine_; and that for
the _Seed_, a small part of the highest Spirit rectified from it.

13. §. So likewise for its Protection, in order to the prosperous
carrying on and perfecting of its generation, and security being
perfected. Which protection it gives not only to the Seminal _Sap_
and _Seed_ it self, but ever also to its _Seed-Branch_. Thus we see
an _Apple_, besides that it is it self of ample compass, for the
sake of its _Seed_, hath likewise its _Coar_; as if it were not
sufficient, that the Walls of their Room are so very thick, unless
also _wainscoated_. In a _Pear_ again, where the _Parenchyma_ is of
less compass than that of an _Apple_, to what protection this affords,
that of the _Calculary_ is super-added. But in a _Plum_, where the
_Parenchyma_ is exceeding tender, and in a _Peach_, which hangs late,
and till Autumn Frosts approach, we have not only the Rubbish of a
_Calculary_, but stout Stone-Walls. Within which also, not only the
_Seed_ it self, but the _Seed-Branch_ is evermore immur’d. Lastly, in a
_Nut_, where the _Shell_ being not surrounded with a _Parenchyma_, that
protection is wanting without, ’tis answer’d by an ample _Pith_ within
it; and the _Seed-Branch_ likewise included, not meerly in the _Body_
of the _Shell_, as in a _Plum_, but within the _Pith_ it self. So
necessary is this design, that what the Hen by Incubation or Hovering,
is to the Egg or Chick; that the whole _Fruit_, by comprehension, is to
the _Seed_.




                               CHAP. VII.

               _Of the SEED, in its State of Generation._


AS the Original, so the Ultimate end and Perfection of _Vegetation_
is the _Seed_. How it is the former, and in its state apt for
_Vegetation_, hath already been seen. How the latter, and in its state
of Generation, we shall now lastly enquire. In doing which, what in the
other state, was either not distinctly existent, or not so apparent, or
not so intelligible, will occur.

2. §. The two general _Parts_ of the _Seed_ are its _Covers_ and
_Body_. The _Covers_ in this estate are usually _Four_. The outmost, we
may call the _Case_. ’Tis of a very various form; sometimes a _Pouch_,
as in _Nasturtium_, _Cochlearia_; a _Cod_, as in all _Pulse_, _Galega_;
sometimes not entire, but parted, or otherwise open, as in _Sorrel_,
_Knotgrass_; with many other forms: I think alwaies more heterogeneous
to that of the _Seed_, by which it differs from the proper _Coats_. To
this the _Caps_ of _Nuts_, and the _Parenchyma’s_ of other _Fruits_ are
analogous.

3. §. The two next are properly the _Coats_. In a _Bean_ especially,
and the like; from whence, to avoyd Confusion, the denomination may run
common to the responding _Covers_ of other _Seeds_. The Colour of the
outer, is of all degrees, from White to the Blackness of _Jett_. Its
Figure sometimes Kidney’d, as in _Alcea_, _Behen_, _Poppy_; Triangular,
as in _Polygonatum_, _Sorrel_; Spherically triangular, in _Mentha_,
_Melissa_; Circular, in _Leucoium_, _Amaranthus_; Globular, in _Napus_,
_Asperula_; Oval, in _Speculum Veneris_, _Tithymalus_; half Globe, in
_Coriander_; that which we take for _one_ single round _Seed_, being
a Conjugation of _two_; half Oval, in _Anise_, _Fennel_; Hastal, in
_Lactuca_; Cylindrical, as, if I mistake not, in _Jacobæa_; Pyramidal,
in _Geranium Althææ fol._ with many other differences. But the
Perfection of one or two of the said Figures lieth in the _Case_. So
that, as all _Lines_ and _Proportions_ are in the _Leaf_ and _Flower_;
so all Regular _Solids_ in the _Seed_; or rather in its _Covers_.

4. §. ’Tis sometimes glistering, as in _Speculum Veneris_; Rough-cast,
in _Catanance_; Studded, in _Behen_, _Balttaria_; Favous, in _Papaver_,
_Antirrhinum_, _Lepidum annuum_, _Alcea Vesicaria_, _Hyoscyamus_,
and many more, before the _Seeds_ have lain long by; Pounced, in
_Phalangium Cretæ_, _Lithospermum_; Ramified, in _Pentaphyllum
fragiferum Erectum majus_, resembling the _Fibers_ of the _Ears_ of
the _Heart_; some just _Quinquenerval_, as in _Anisum_, and many more,
the _Lignous Body_ being in five main _Fibers_ branched therein. The
_Figures_, and _Surface_, of These, and other _Seeds_, See in the
Tables belonging to the _Fourth_ =Part= of the _Fourth_ =Book=.

5. §. The _Covers_ of not only _Quince-Seeds_, and those of _Psyllium_
(more usually taken notice of) but those also of _Horminum_,
_Nasturtium_, _Eruca_, _Camelina_, _Ocymum_, and divers others, have
a _Mucilage_. Which, though it be not visible when the _Seeds_ are
throughly dry; yet lying a while in some warm Liquor, or only on the
Tongue, it swells more or less, and upon them all fairly shews it self.
On that of _Ocymum_ it appears grayish; on the other, transparent; and
on that of _Nasturtium Hortense_ very large; even emulous of the inner
Pulp surrounding a _Gooseberry-Seed_. The putting of _Clary-seed_ into
the Eye, may have been brought into use from this _Mucilage_, by which
alone it may become Medicinal. And thus far of the _Superficies_.

6. §. The _nature_ of the outer _Coat_ is also various, _Membranous_,
_Cartilaginous_ and _Stony_; the like _Precipitations_ being sometimes
made herein, as in a _Stone_ or _Shell_; as in that of the _Seeds_
of _Carthamum_, _Lithospermum_ and others. The Designment hereof,
being either with respect to the _Seed_ in its state of Generation;
as where the _Case_ is either wanting, or at least insufficient of it
self, there for its due protection and warmth. Or, in its state of
_Vegetation_, for the better Fermenting of its _Tinctures_ and _Sap_;
the Fermentations of some _Seeds_ not well proceeding, unless they lie
in their _Stony Casks_ in the Ground, like Bottled Liquors in Sand.

7. §. All _Seeds_ have their outer _Covers_ open; either by a
particular _Foramen_, as in _Beans_, and other _Pulse_, as is said; or
by the breaking off of the _Seed_ from its _Peduncle_ or _Stool_, as
in those in _Cucumber_, _Cichory_; or by the entering and passage of
a _Branch_ or _Branches_, not only into the Concave thereof near the
Cone, but also through the Cone it self; as in _Shells_ and _Stones_.

8. §. For the sake of this _aperture_ it is, that _Akerns_, _Nuts_,
_Beans_, _Cucumbers_, and most other _Seeds_, are in their formation
so placed, that the _Radicle_ still standeth next to it; That So, upon
_Vegetation_, it may have a free and ready passage into the Mould.

9. §. The Original of the outer _Coat_, though from Parts of the
same substantial nature, yet is differently made. In a _Plum_, the
_Seed-Branch_ which runns, as is described, through the _Stone_,
is not naked, but, as is said, invested with a thin _Parenchyma_,
which it carries from the _Stalk_ along with it; and which, by the
_Ramification_ of the said _Branch_ within the _Stone_, is, in part,
dilated into a _Coat_. That of a _Bean_ is from the _Parenchyma_ of
the _Cod_; the superficial part of which _Parenchyma_, upon the large
_peduncle_ of the _Bean_ becoming a thin _Cuticle_, and upon the _Bean_
it self a _Cartilaginous Coat_.

10. §. The Original of the inner _Coat_ of the _Bean_ is likewise
from the inner part of the said _Parenchyma_; which first is spred
into a long _Cake_, or that which with the _Seed-Branch_ maketh the
_Penduncle_ of the _Bean_; under which _Cake_, there is usually a black
part or spot; by the length of which, the inner part of the _Cake_ is
next inserted into the outer _Coat_, and spred all over the Concave
thereof, and so becomes the inner.

11. §. Of this Inner _Coat_ it is very observable, That although when
the _Seed_ is grown old and dry, ’tis shrunk up, and in most _Seeds_,
so far, as scarcely to be discern’d; yet in its first and juvenile
Constitution, it is a very Spongy and Sappy body; and is then likewise
(as the _Womb_ in a Pregnant _Animal_) in proportion, very thick and
bulky. In a _Bean_, even as one of the _Lobes_ it self: And in a _Plum_
or _Apricot_, I think I may safely say, half an hundred times thicker
than afterwards, when it is dried and shrunk up, and can scarcely be
distinguished from the upper _Coat_. Upon which Accounts it is, in this
estate a true and fair _Parenchyma_. The Delineation hereof, See in the
_Figures_ belonging to the _Fourth_ =Part= of the _Fourth_ =Book=.

12. §. In this Inner _Coat_ in a _Bean_, the _Lignous Body_ or
_Seed-Branch_ is distributed: Sometimes, as in _French-Beans_,
throughout the whole _Coat_, as it is in a _Leaf_. In the Great
_Garden-Bean_, upon its first entrance, it is bipartite, and so in
small _Branches_ runs along the _Circumference_ of the _Coat_, all
meeting and making a kind of _Reticulation_ against the Belly of the
_Bean_. In the same manner the main _Branches_ in the outer _Coat_
of a _Kernel_, circling themselves on both hands from the place of
their first entrance, at last meet, and mutually inosculate; as the
_Veins_ in the _Kidneys_ of a Man or any _Quadrupede_; Or the _Carotick
Arteries_ in the _Braine_.

13. §. So that all the _Parts_ of a _Vegetable_, the _Root_, _Trunk_,
_Branch_, _Leaf_, _Flower_, _Fruit_ and _Seed_, are still made up of
_Two_ Substantially different Bodies.

14. §. And as every _Part_ hath _Two_, so the whole _Vegetable_ taken
together, is a composition of _Two_ only, and no more: All properly
_Woody Parts_, _Strings_ and _Fibers_, are _One Body_: All simple
_Barques_, _Piths_, _Parenchyma’s_ and _Pulps_, and as to their
substantial Nature, _Pills_ and _Skins_ likewise, all but _One Body_:
the several _Parts_ of a _Vegetable_ all differing from each other,
only by the various _Proportions_ and _Mixtures_, and variated _Pores_
and _Structure_ of these _Two Bodies_. What from these two general
Observations might reasonably be inferr’d, I shall not now mention.

15. §. The Fourth or Innermost _Cover_ we may call the _Secondine_.
The sight of which, by cutting off the _Coats_ of an _Infant-Bean_,
at the Cone thereof, in very thin Slices, and with great Caution,
may be obtain’d. While unbroken, ’tis transparent; being torn and
taken off, it gathers up into the likeness of a Jelly, or that we
call the _Tredle_ of an Egg, when rear-boyl’d. This _Membrance_ in
larger or elder _Beans_, is not to be found distinct. But (as far as
our Enquiries yet discover) it may in most other _Seeds_, even full
grown, be distinctly seen; as in those of _Cucumber_, _Colocynthis_,
_Burdock_, _Carthamum_, _Gromwel_, _Endive_, _Mallows_, &c. ♦ _Tab. 4.
f. 16._ ♦ ’Tis usually so very thin, as in the above-nam’d, as very
difficultly to be discover’d. But in some _Kernels_, as of _Apricots_,
’tis very thick; and most remarquably such, in some other _Seeds_. That
all these have the Analogy of one and the same _Cover_, which I call
the _Secondine_, is most probably argu’d from their alike Natures;
being all of them plain simple _Membranes_, with not the least _Fibre_
of the _Lignous Body_ or _Seed Branch_, visibly distributed in them:
As also from their Texture, which is in all of them more close. See
this _Part_ in _Tab. 4._ As also amongst the _Figures_ belonging to the
_Fourth_ =Part= of the _Fourth_ =Book=.

16. §. The _Concave_ of this _Membrane_ is filled with a most
transparent _Liquor_, out of which the _Seed_ is formed; as in cutting
a _petite_ and _Infant-Bean_, may be seen; and yet better in a young
_Walnut_. In _Beans_ I have observed it to turn, upon boyling, into a
tender white _Coagulum_.

17. §. Through this _Membrane_, the _Lignous Body_ or _Seed-Branches_
distributed in the inner _Coat_, at last shoot downright two slender
_Fibres_, like two _Navel-strings_, one into each _Lobe_ of the
_Bean_. ♦ _Tab. 4. f. 18._ ♦The places where the said _Fibres_ shoot
into the _Lobes_, are near the _Basis_ of the _Radicle_; and by their
_Blackishness_ well enough remark’d: but the _Fibers_ themselves are
so very small, as scarcely to be discern’d. Yet in a _Lupine_, of the
larger kind, both the _places_ where the _Navel-Fibres_ shoot into the
_Lobes_ (which here from the _Basis_ of the _Radicle_ is more remote)
and the _Fibres_ themselves, are fairly visible. For the _Seed-Branch_,
upon its entrance into the _Coat_ of the _Lupine_, is presently divided
into two _main Branches_, and those two into other less; whereof some
underly, others aloft, run along the _Coat_, and towards its other
end meet and are inosculated: where about, two opposite, shallow,
round, and most minute _Cavities_, answerable to two _Specks_ of a
_Cartilaginous_ gloss, ♦ _Tab. 4. f. 17._ ♦ one in either _Lobe_, may
be observed; which _Specks_ are the ends of the said _Navel-Fibres_,
upon the ripening of the _Seed_ there broken off. These _Fibres_
from the _Superficies_ of each _Lobe_, descend a little way directly
down: presently, each is divided into two _Branches_, one distributed
into the _Lobes_, the other into the _Radicle_ and _Plume_, ♦ _Tab.
4. f. 18._ ♦ in the manner as in the _First Chapter_ is described.
And thus far the History. I shall now only with a brief account of
the _Generation_ of the _Seed_, as hereupon dependent, conclude this
Discourse.


♦ An Account of the _Generation_ of the _Seed_. ♦ 18. §. LET US say
then, that the _Sap_ having in the _Root_, _Trunk_ and _Leaves_, passed
divers _Concoctions_ and _Separations_, in the manner as they are said
to be perform’d therein; ’tis now at last, in some good maturity,
advanced towards the _Seed_.

19. §. The more copious and cruder part hereof is again separated by a
free reception into the _Fruit_, or other _Part_ analogous to it: being
either sufficiently ample to contain it, or at least laxe enough for
its transpiration, and so its due discharge. The more Essential part
is into the _Seed-Branch_ or _Branches_ entertain’d. Which, because
they are evermore of a very considerable length, and of a Constitution
very fine, the said _Sap_ thus becomes in its Current therein as in the
_Spermatick Vessels_, still more mature.

20. §. In this mature estate, from the _Seed-Branch_ into the _Coats_
of the _Seed_, as into the _Womb_, ’tis next delivered up. The meaner
part hereof again, to the _Outer_, as _Aliment_ good enough, is
supplied. The finer part is transmitted to the _Inner_; which being, as
is said, a _Parenchymous_ and more spatious _Body_, the _Sap_ therefore
is not herein, as in the _Outer_, a meer _Aliment_; but in order to its
being, by _Fermentation_, farther prepared.

21. §. Yet the Outer _Coat_, being on the contrary hard and dense;
for that reason, as it admitteth not the Fermentation of the _Sap_ so
well within it self; so doth it the more promote and favour it in the
Inner; being Bounds both to it and its _Sap_; and also quickeneth the
_process_ of the whole Work in the formation of the _Seed_.

22. §. Nor doth the Outer _Coat_, for the same reason, more promote,
than declare the purity of the _Sap_ now contained in the Inner: For
being more hard and dense, and so not perspirable, must needs suppose
the Parts of the _Sap_ encompassed by it, since thus uncapable of any
evacuation, to be therefore all so choice, as not to need it.

23. §. The _Sap_ being thus prepared in the Inner _Coat_, as a _Liquor_
now apt to be the _Substratum_ of the future _Seed-Embrio_; by fresh
supplies, is thence discharg’d. Yet that it may not be over-copious;
which, because of the laxity of the Inner _Coat_, from whence it
issues, it might easily be: therefore, as the said Inner _Coat_ is
bounded without, by the upper _Coat_; so by the _Secundine_, is it
bounded within. Through which _Secundine_ the _Sap_ being filtr’d,
or, as it were, transpiring; the depositure hereof, answerable to the
_Colliquamentum_ in an Egg, or to the _Semen Mulibre_, into its Concave
at last is made.

24. §. The other part of the purest _Sap_ embosom’d in the _Ramulets_
of the _Seed-Branch_, runs a Circle, or some progress therein; and so
becomes, as the _Semen Masculinum_, yet more elaborate.

25. §. Wherein also, lest its Current should be too copious or
precipitant, by their _co-arcture_ and _divarication_ where they are
inosculated, it is retarded; the noblest portion only obtaining a pass.

26. §. With this purest _Sap_, the said _Ramulets_ being supplied, from
thence at last, the _Navel-Fibres_ shoot (as the primitive _Artery_
into the _Colliquamentum_) through the _Secundine_ into the aforesaid
_Liquor_ deposited therein.

27. §. Into which _Liquor_, being now shot, and its own proper _Sap_ or
_Tinctures_ mixed therewith, it _strikes_ it thus into a _Coagulum_; or
of a _Liquor_, it becomes a _Body consistent_ and truly _Parenchymous_.
And the supply of the said _Liquor_ still continu’d, and the shooting
of the _Navel-Fibres_, as is above described, still carried on, the
said _Coagulation_ or _Fixation_ is therewith likewise.

28. §. And in the Interim of the _Coagulation_, a gentle _Fermentation_
being also made, the said _Parenchyma_ or _Coagulum_ becometh such, not
of any Texture indifferently, but is thus raised (as we see Bread in
Baking) into a _Congeries_ of _Bladders_: For such is the _Parenchyma_
of the whole _Seed_.

_MY LORD_,

If the Dedication of _Books_ were not in use; yet here, I think, I
might have been a Precedent. The promotion of _Phytological Science_
is one Part of _Your_ Work; and ’tis _You_ have called me to the
management of this Part; for some time, have intrusted me herein;
and by _Your_ most favourable and candid acceptance of what I have
performed thus far, have encouraged me hereunto: I therefore present
but _Your_ Own, into _Your_ Hands.

The great Honour and Advantage of _Your_ Fellowship, I first obtained,
by Mediation of Dr. _Wilkins_, the late most Reverend _Bishop_ of
_Chester_. Whom I cannot name, without saying thus much of him, That
He was a Person of that eminent and happy Worth, which, as it was too
good, to fear envy; so is it too great, to need an Elogie.

With Him, it was, _You_ were pleased to commit to Me, the further
prosecution of this _Work_; the Beginnings whereof, were by _Your
Order_ formerly made publique. Had I consulted my own Abilities
altogether, I should scarcely have ventured upon it; seeing very
little, for which I could think well of my self, saving, That I had
learned, upon good grounds, to think of _You_ with greatest Honour.
But I also considered, That to insist hereon too much, might be a
reflection upon _Your_ Judgments, who had thought fit to make choice of
Me. And, That _You_ were not more the Patrons of Wit, than of Industry;
and of All, who shall endeavour to find out, or to confirm the Truth
of Things. Withal, I looked upon _Nature_, as a Treasure so infinitely
full; that as all Men together, cannot exhaust it; so no Man, but may
find out somewhat therein, if he be resolved to Try.

In compliance therefore with _Your_ Commands, I have hereunto
devoted a very considerable part of my Time. These, adding force to
my own Desires, of being somewhat instrumental to the Improvement
of Medicinal, and other wholesom Knowledge: if peradventure, as we
increase herein, we may become better, and more happy. As to which
Improvement, though I could not hope; yet, I would not dispair. I have
already prepared the Soil, and made some Plantation: what remaineth
behind, and the Vintage of the whole, will depend much upon the
continued Influence of _Your_ Beams: for how unpromising soever the
Stock may be; yet the Fruit cannot but be somewhat matured, upon which
_You_ are pleased to shine. I am also confident, that the same Nobilty
and Goodness, which accept the endeavours, will likewise pardon the
faults, of,

                                _My Lord,
                       Your Lordships most humbly
                            and most sincerly
                            devoted Servant_

                                CHAP. I.

        _Of the ORIGINAL, FIGURES, MOTIONS, and AGES of ROOTS._


BEING TO speak of _Roots_; it is requisite, for our better
understanding of what follows, that some things, as to their
_Original_, _Figures_, _Motions_ and _Ages_, be premised.

1. §. _Roots_, taken altogether, have a Three-fold Original. Either
from the _Radicle_; as all _Roots_ which come of the _Seed_: or from
the _Trunk_ or _Caulis_, above ground; as in _Strawberry_, _Chamæmile_,
and many other _Creepers_: or from the _Trunk_ or _Caulis_, after it is
sunk under ground; as in _Primrose_, _Bistort_, and many others; and
presently shall be shewed how.

2. §. In the Growth of a _Bud_, and of a _Trunk-Root_, there is this
observable difference; That the former, carries along with it, some
portion of every _Part_ in the _Trunk_ or _Stalk_; whereof it is a
_Compendium_. The latter, always shoots forth, by making a Rupture in
the _Barque_, which it leaves behind, and proceeds only from the inner
part of the _Stalk_.

3. §. As also, That in a _Bud_, the _Lignous Part_ is spread abroad, so
as to encompass a _Pith_. Whereas in a _Trunk-Root_, it makes a solid
Thred standing in the Center. Which is the Cause of its descending into
the Ground: as is already, in the _First_ =Book=, and shall in This be
further shewed.


4. §. ROOTS are generally distinguished, as to their _Figures_, in
being more Entire, as is that of _Liquirish_; or Parted, as of St.
_Johns-wort_. Parted or Forked, either at the Bottom, as most _Roots_;
or at the Top, as _Dandelyon_, and some others. A thing very odd, and
unintelligible, without the knowledge of the _Motions_ of _Roots_;
whereof presently.

5. §. Parted, again, are either Ramified, as that of _Cumfry_; or
Manifold, as of _Crowfoot_: both are Parted; but the former, by the
subdivision of greater _Branches_, into lesser; these, when divers
_Strings_, have all their distinct original from one _Head_. Some
are Straight, as a _Radish_; others Crooked, as _Bistort_. Smooth,
as _Bugloss_; or Stringy all round about, as _Columbine_. And to
_Carnations_, this seems to be peculiar, That sometimes many of the
_Strings_ run parallell with the _Wood_ of the great _Root_, through
the _Barque_, or betwixt the _Wood_ and the _Barque_.

6. §. Again, some are Thick, as _Rhubarb_; Slender, as the _Vine_.
Long, as _Fenil_; Short, as a _Turnep_: which are distinct from Great
and Little; in that these, are so called with respect to several
_Roots_; those, with respect to the several Dimensions of one. Short,
are Stubbed, as _Iris tuberosa_; or Round, as _Dracontium_. Round are
Tuberous, or Simply Knobbed, as _Rape-Crowfoot_; Bulbous, that is
Scaled, as some Lilys; or Shell’d, as an _Onion_. Where note, That
all Bulbous _Roots_, are, as it were, Hermaphrodites, or _Root_ and
_Trunk_ both together: for the _Strings_ only, are absolute _Roots_;
the _Bulb_, actually containing those _Parts_, which springing up, make
the _Leaves_ or _Body_; and is, as it were, a Great _Bud_ under ground.

7. §. _Roots_, again, are Even or Uneven; Even, are Cylindrical, as
_Eryngo_; or Pyramidal, as _Borage_. Growing smaller Downwards, as do
most; or Upwards, as _Skirrets_. Uneven, are Pitted, as _Potato’s_,
where the _Eyes_ or _Buds_ of the future _Trunks_ lie inward; or
Knotted, as _Jerusalem-Artichoke_; where they stand out. These
Differences, are also Compounded: so some _Roots_ are both Entire and
Smooth, as _Peony_; others Entire, but Stringy, as _Clary_: that is,
neither Ramifi’d, nor yet Brushy, or divided at the Top into severall
small _Strings_; but a Single _Root_ surrounded with many Hairy
_Threds_. Some both Plain in some parts, and Knobbed in others, as
_Filipendula_, _Lilium non bulbosum_, and others.

8. §. Some also have two or more _Roots_; and those of one Kind: of
which, some are distinctly fastend to the bottome of the _Stalk_, as
in _Dogstones_; some stand one under another, so as only the uppermost
is fasten’d to the _Stalk_, as in _Dragon_, _Crocus_, and others. And
there are some, which have not only two _Roots_, at the same time;
but those also of two distinct Kinds, as in _Bistort_; one of them, a
slender strait Cylindrick and horizontall _Root_; the other large and
crooked, and bred of the Descending _Trunk_; as in speaking next of the
_Motions_ of _Roots_, will be understood, how. All which, with other
Differences by Those that undertake the _Descriptions_ of _Plants_,
are accurately to be Noted. But the Differences, above mentioned, will
serve for our present Purpose.


9. §. THE MOTIONS of _Roots_ are also divers. Sometimes Level, as
are those of _Hops_, _Ammi_, _Cinquefoyle_; and all such as properly
_Creep_. Sometimes Perpendicular, as that of _Parsnep_: Which is
different from Straightness; for some Straight _Roots_, are Level.
Both of them are either Shallow or Deep: some run Level, and near the
_Turf_, as _Woodbind_, _Wild Anenomy_; others lower, as _Dogs-Grass_.
Some strike down, but a little way, as _Stramonium_; others grow deep,
as _Horse-Radish_: Which is different from being Long; for many long
_Roots_, are Level, as _Hops_.

10. §. Some again Descend, as _Tulips_, and other Bulbous _Roots_,
which differs from growing only Downwards; in that here, the _Head_ of
the _Root_ is Immoveable; but in Descending, the whole _Root_ obteineth
different Places, running deeper, time after time, into the _Earth_.
Some also Ascend, sometimes, and in some part, appearing above ground,
as _Turneps_.

11. §. These _Motions_ are also Compounded; both in respect of the
several Parts of the _Root_, and of several Times. So the main _Root_
of _Primrose_, is Level; the Strings are Perpendicular. The _Roots_
of most _Seedlings_ grow Downward and Upward, or shoot out in length
at both Ends, at the same time. Those of _Bistort_, _Iris_, and some
others, grow, in part, both Downward and Upward at several times:
Whence it is, that _Bistort_ is Crooked, with some resemblance to an
S, according to its _Name_; And that some Parts of _Iris-Root_ appear
oftentimes above the ground.

12. §. There is also another _Motion_, in some _Roots_, not heeded; and
that is _Contortion_: whereby, without being moved out of their Place,
they are Writhed or Twisted; as a piece of Cloath is, when the Water
is wrung out of it; as in _Carduus_, _Sonchus_, and others: whether
always I cannot say. This _Motion_ cannot be noted, without stripping
off the _Barque_; whereby the _Vessels_ may be seen, sometimes, to
make two or three Circumvolutions. This _Motion_ seems to be governed
by the winding of the _Stalk_; and therefore to begin at the Head, and
terminate at the Poynt or lower end of the _Root_, which is immoveable.


13. §. BUT ABOVE all the _Motions_ of _Roots_, not observed, the most
remarkable is that of DESCENT. Which, although it hath been noted, by
some _Botanicks_, of _Bulbous Roots_; yet of these only: Whereas it is
the Property, of a great many more; and those, of very different Kinds;
probably, of the far greater number of _Perennial Roots_ of _Herbs_;
as of _Arum_, _Rape-Crowfoot_, _Valerian_, _Brownwort_, _Bears-foot_,
_Tansy_, _Lychnis_, _Sampier_, _Primrose_, _Ammi_, _Avens_,
_Wood-sorrel_, _Iris_, and others. Of all which _Plants_, it is very
observable, That their _Root_, is annually _renewed_, or _repaired_,
out of the _Trunk_ or _Stalk_ it self. That is to say, The _Basis_ of
the _Stalk_ continually, and by insensible Degrees, descending below
the surface of the _Earth_, and hiding it self therein; is thus,
both in Nature, Place, and Office changed into a true _Root_. Which
_Root_, by the continuance of the said _Motion_ of the _Stalk_, also
_Descends_; and so, according to the durableness of its Substance,
becomes a shorter or longer _Root_; the Elder or Lower Portion thereof,
Rotting off, by the same Degrees with the Generation of the Upper, out
of the _Stalk_. So in _Brownwort_, the _Basis_ of the _Stalk_ sinking
down by degrees, till it lies under Ground, becomes the upper part of
the _Root_; and continuing still to sink, the next year, becomes the
lower Part; and the next after that, rots away; a new Addition being
still yearly made out of the _Stalk_, as the elder Parts yearly rot
away. ♦ _Tab. 5. f. 6, & 7._ ♦ So in _Dragon_, _Crocus_, and the like,
where the _Root_ is double; the _Basis_ of the _Stalk_, this year; the
next, becomes the Upper-_Root_; after that, the Lower-_Root_; and at
the length dies and is consum’d.

14. §. The Demonstration hereof, is taken, more evidently, from some
_Roots_, than from others; as from the Level and Knobed _Roots_ of
_Wood-sorrel_, _Primrose_, &c. ♦ _Tab. 5. f. 1, & 2._ ♦ For the
_Leaves_ of those _Plants_ rotting off successively, and the _Bases_
of those _Leaves_ gradually descending into the Ground; each _Basis_
is thus nourished with a more copious _Sap_, and so swelled into so
many thick _Knots_. It may likewise be gather’d in some, from the like
Position of the _Vessels_ or Woody Parts, in the _Root_, as in the
_Trunk_; as in _Bares-foot_, As also, from the _Root_ of the _Iris
Tuberosa_: ♦ _Tab. 5. f. 4._ ♦ where, although the _Leaves_ fall off
close to the Surface of the _Stalk_; yet after that is sunk down, and
swell’d into a _Root_, the _Seats_ of the perished _Leaves_, and the
Ends of the _Vessels_ belonging to them, are not obscurely visible;
whereby the _Root_ is wrought, as it were, with several _Seames_ and
_Prickt Lines_; the _Seams_ shewing the setting on of the _Leaves_; and
the _Pricks_, the Terminations or broken Ends of the _Vessels_: which
ends, are still more apparent, upon the stripping off the _Barque_. I
considered likewise, That as among _Animals_, there are many, which are
not Bred of _Eggs_, immediately; but are Transformed, one _Animal_ into
another: So, it is more than probable, That among _Plants_, there are
not a few Instances of the like _Transformations_; whereof, this is one.

15. §. The _Cause_ of this _Descent_, so far as it is dependent on
the Inward Conformation of the _Root_, I shall shew in the following
=Part=. But the Immediate Visible one, are the _String-Roots_,
which this kind of _Trunks_ frequently put forth: which, descending
themselves directly into the Ground, like so many _Ropes_, lug the
_Trunk_ after them. Hence the _Tuberous-Roots_ of _Iris_ upon the
rotting or fading away of the _String-Roots_ hanging at them, sometimes
a little Re-ascend. Hence also the _Shape_ of some _Roots_ is Inverted:
For whereas most are parted downwards, into several _Legs_; some are
parted upwards into divers _Necks_, as _Dandelyon_, and others. ♦
_Tab. 5. f. 5._ ♦ For these _Roots_ sending forth at the top several
_Trunk-Buds_, the said _Buds_ successively put forth new, and cast
their old _Leaves_; and continually also making their Descent, are
at length formed into so many _Necks_, of three, four, five, or more
Inches long, under Ground.


16. §. HENCE ALSO we understand, in what particular way, some _Roots_
become _Perennial_. Some are wholly so, as those of _Trees_, _Shrubs_,
and divers other woody _Plants_. Others, in part, or by a new
_Progenies_ of _Roots_, from the old Head or Body, in the room of those
that die yearly, or after a certain Time; as of _Lilium non bulbosum_,
_Jerusalem Artichoke_, _Potato_, _Dog-stones_, _Monks-hood_, _little
Celandine_, and others. In which _Plants_, one or more of their _Roots_
are firm, the other spongy and superannuated; and partly, by the ravine
of the _Trunk_, and other younger _Roots_, reduced to a Consumption and
Death.

17. §. With these, _Tulips_, and other _Bulbous-Roots_ consort: For
the several _Rindes_ & _Shells_, whereof chiefly, the _Bulb_ consists,
successively perish and shrink up into so many thin and dry _Skins_:
betwixt which, and in their Centre, other _Leaves_ and _Shells_, being
successively formed, the _Bulb_ is thus perpetuated. In the same manner
the _String-Roots_ also succeed one another annually. So that at the
end of divers Years, although it be still looked upon as the same
_Individual Root_, yet it is, in truth, Another, as to every particle
thereof.

18. §. Lastly, many other _Roots_ are perpetuated by the aforesaid
Descent of the _Trunk_; out of which, it is still annually Repaired,
as by the gradual perishing of its lower parts, it is Diminished; as
hath been said. Whence also we see the reason of the Rugged and Blunt
extremities of these, ♦ _Tab. 5. f. 3._ ♦ and some other _Roots_, as
of that _Plant_ superstitiously called _Devils-bit_: because the end
of it seems to be bitten off. Yet doth it not appear so originally;
but the Lower part thereof rotting off, as the Upper descends; the
living remainder, becometh stumped, or seemeth Bitten. Thus far of the
_Original_, _Shapes_, _Motions_, and _Ages_ of _Roots_.




                                CHAP. II.

                             _Of the SKIN._


I NEXT proceed to the several _Parts_ whereof a _Root_ is Compounded.
The outer _Part_ of all is the _Skin_; which is common to all _Roots_.
’Tis diversly Coloured: Whiter in _Skirrets_; Yellow, in _Dock_; Red,
in _Potato_; Brown, in _Lovage_; Black, in _Bugloss_. Its Surface,
sometimes Smooth, as in _Hors-radish_; Rough, as in _Scorzonera_. And
the _Skins_ of the several _Shells_ of a _Tulip-Root_, taken up fresh,
look as if they were perforated with a great many small holes. ’Tis of
various Size; very Thin, in _Parsnep_; somewhat Thick, in _Bugloss_;
very Thick in _Iris_. Sometimes it is Opacous, as in _Thistle_; and
sometimes Transparent, as in _Madder_.

2. §. Every _Root_ hath successively two kinds of _Skins_: the one,
Coëtaneous with the other _Parts_; and hath its original from that
which involved the _Parts_ of the _Seed_ it self. The other, Postnate,
succeeding in the room of the former, as the _Root_ ageth; and is
originated from the _Bark_. So in _Dandelyon_, the old _Skin_, looked
upon about the beginning of _May_, seems to have been one of those
several _Rings_, which the precedent year composed the _Cortical
Body_ of the _Root_: but by the Generation of a new _Ring_, next the
_Wood_, is now thrust off and shrunk up into a _Skin_. ♦ _Tab. 14,
15._ ♦ So also in the _Roots_ of _Bugloss_ and _Horse-Radish_, as far
as the _Bladders_ in the former, and the _Vessels_ in the latter are
Radiated; the _Cortical Body_ seems either annually or oftener, to
shrink up into another new _Skin_, as, the old ones fall off. ♦ _Tab.
10._ ♦ And sometimes, perhaps, as in _Assparagus_, the whole body of
the Perpendicular _Roots_, except the woody _Fibre_ in the Centre,
becomes the second _Skin_. So that the wearing away of the old _Skin_,
succeeds the derivation of the new one; as in Descending _Roots_, the
Consumption of the Lower _Parts_, doth the Generation of the Upper.
Because the _Barque_ swells, and grows sometimes faster than the _Skin_
can fall off, or give way to it: therefore are the _Roots_ of many
_Herbs_, Barquebound, as well as the _Trunks_ of _Trees_.

3. §. This _Skin_ is usually, if not always, compounded of two
Kinds of Bodies: which also is probable of the Coëtaneous. The one,
_Parenchymous_, and frequently constructed of exceeding little _Cells_
or _Bladders_; which in some _Roots_, as of _Asparagus_, cut traverse,
and viewed through a _Microscope_, are plainly visible. ♦ _Tab. 10._
♦ These _Bladders_ are of different Sizes; in _Buglos_, larger; in
_Asparagus_ less; and sometimes they coincide and disappear. ♦ _Tab.
14._ ♦ But in these, and all other _Roots_, even where these _Bladders_
appear nor, the _Parenchyma_ of the _Skin_, is of the same Substantial
_Nature_, with that other more vivid and bulky one of the _Bark_: As
is manifest, from its being thence Originated; and alike Conformed, as
shall be seen; and not only adjacent to it, as a Glove is to the Hand;
but continuous therewith, as the parts of a piece of flesh, are one
with another.


4. §. OF THIS _Parenchymous Body_, the _Skin_ consisteth chiefly, but
not wholly; there being many _Lignous Vessels_ which are Tubulary,
mixed therewith: which, though hardly by the _Microscope_, yet
otherwise, is demonstrable. For in tearing the _Skin_, you shall do it
more easily by the length, than bredth; because, by the first way, the
continuity only of the _Parenchyma_, is dissolved; but by the latter,
both of this, and of the _Vessels_, these being posited by the length
of the _Root_: So that, as by the smalness of the _Bladders_ of the
_Parenchyma_, the _Skin_ is Dense; so by these _Vessels_, is it Tough.

5. §. Again, if you cut a _Root_ traverse, and let it lie by for some
time, all the parts, where there are no _Vessels_, shrink below the
surface of the cut-end; but where-ever These are posited, there is no
shrinking; which oftentimes, evidently appears also in the _Skin_:
because the said _Vessels_, though, as the _Bladders_, they may
coincide; yet they cannot visibly shorten or shrink up in length; no
more than a _Straw_, whose sides may yet be easily crushed together.

6. §. Further, the _Root_ being cut traverse, if, near the cut-end,
you very gently press the side of the _Root_ with the edge of your
Nail, the _Sap_ will thereupon arise sometimes from the _Skin_; in
the same manner, as from any other part of the _Root_, where the like
_Vessels_ are posited. And although the _Sap_ may likewise be expressed
from the _Pith_, and other _Parts_ where sometimes, there are none of
these _Vessels_; yet not without a solution of there continuity; which
here doth not follow; as appears, from the disappearing of the _Sap_,
together with the intermission of the pressure; the said _Vessels_
then dilating themselves by a Motion of _Restitution_, and so sucking
up the _Sap_ again.

7. §. Hereunto may be added the Testimony of sight; the very _Vessels_
themselves, in many _Roots_, coming under an apparent view, and
standing in the utmost surface of the _Root_ all round about, as
in that of Liquirish, Columbine, Scorzonera, and others. Which
_Experiments_, I have here, once for all, more particularly set down;
because I shall have occasion, hereafter, to refer to them.




                               CHAP. III.

                            _Of the BARQUE._


NEXT WITHIN the _Skin_ lieth the _Barque_. ’Tis sometimes Yellow, as in
_Dock_; Red, in _Bistort_; but usually, and in _Seed-Roots_, I think,
always White. It is derived from the _Seed_ it self; being but the
extension or prolongation of the _Parenchyma_ of the _Radicle_; One of
the three _Organical Parts_ of the _Seed_, described in the _First_
=Chapter= of the _First_ =Book=.

2. § It is variously Sized; sometimes very Thin, as in _Jerusalem
Artichoke_, _Goats-beard_, and in most _Trees_; where it also retains
the Name of a _Barque_ or _Rind_. Sometimes ’tis more Thick, and maketh
up the far greatest portion of the _Root_, as in the String-_Roots_ of
_Asparagus_, in _Dandelion_, and others. The thinnest and the thickest
are all analogous, and obtain the same general Uses. The degrees of
its Size, amongst all _Roots_, may be well reckoned about Twenty, and
seen in the following examples, ♦ _Tab. 7, 8, 9._ ♦ _sc._ _Beet_,
_Dropwort_, _Jerusalem Artichoke_, _Orpine_, _Valerian_, _Goats-beard_,
_Nettle_, _Brownwort_, _Columbine_, _Celandine_, _Asparagus_,
_Horse-Radish_, _Peony_, _Bryony_, _Eryngo_, _Borage_, _Lovage_,
_Dandelion_, _Parsnep_, _Carrot_, _&c._ In the _Root_ of _Beet_, scarce
exceeding a good thick _Skin_: but in a _Carrot_, half the Semidiameter
of the _Root_, or above half an Inch over in some places: and that of
_Dandelion_, sometimes, in proportion with the _woody Part_, twice as
thick: the rest of Several intermediate Degrees: And to most _Roots_,
this is common, To have their _Barque_ proportionably thicker, at the
bottome than at the top.


3. §. IT IS Compounded of two _Bodies_. The one _Parenchymous_;
Continuous throughout; yet somewhat Pliable without a solution of its
Continuity. Exceeding Porous; as appeareth from its so much shrinking
up, in drying. The _Pores_ hereof are extended much alike both by the
length and bredth of the _Root_; therefore it shrinketh up, by both
those Dimensions, more equally. And they are very Dilative; as is
also manifest from its restorableness to its former bulk again, upon
its infusion in Water: that is to say, _It is a most curious and
exquisitely fine wrought Sponge._ Thus much the Eye and Reason may
discover.

4. §. The _Microscope_ confirms the truth hereof, and more precisely
shews, That these _Pores_ are all, in a manner, Spherical, in most
_Plants_; and this _Part_, an Infinite Mass of little _Cells_ or
_Bladders_. The sides of none of them, are Visibly pervious from
one into another; but each is bounded within it self. ♦ _Tab. 10, &
sequent._ ♦ So that the _Parenchyma_ of the _Barque_, is much the same
thing, as to its Conformation, which the Froth of _Beer_ or _Eggs_ is,
as a fluid, or a piece of fine _Manchet_, as a fixed Body. The Sides
also of these _Bladders_ are as transparent, as those of Water; or the
Bodies of some _Insects_.

5. §. But their Size is usually much smaller; and their Posture more
Regular than those in _Bread_ or _Water_. In all _Roots_ they are so
small, as scarcely, without the _Microscope_, to be discerned: yet
are they of different Size, both in the same, and in divers _Roots_;
the varieties whereof, amongst all _Roots_, may be reduced to about
Ten or Twelve according to the _Standard_, in _Tab. 11._ ♦ _Tab. 13,
14._ ♦ Some of those in _Dandelion_, being of the Smallest; and in
_Bugloss_, of the Greatest. They are posited, for the most part, at an
Equal Height; and piled evenly one over another: So that, oftentimes,
they visibly run in Ranks or trains, both by the length and breadth
of the _Roots_, as in the _Root_ of _Bugloss_, or of _Dandelion_,
split through the middle, may be seen. Although they are usually
Spherical, yet sometimes, and in some places, they are more oblonge,
♦ _Tab. 14._ ♦ as in the outward part of the _Barque_ of _Bugloss_.
These _Bladders_, are sometimes best seen, after the _Root_, being cut
traverse, hath layn by awhile, to dry.

6. §. They are the Receptacles of _Liquor_; which is ever Lucid; and
I think, always more Thin or Watery. They are, in all _Seed-Roots_,
filled herewith; and usually, in those also which are well grown, as of
_Borage_, _Radish_, &c.


7. §. THIS _Parenchymous Part_, in many _Roots_, is of one Uniform
_Contexture_; as in _Asparagus_, _Hors-Radish_, _Peony_, _Potato_, and
others. In many others, it is, as it were, of a Diversified _Woof_;
the _Bladders_ being, though every where Regular, yet either in Shape,
Size, or Situation, different in some Parts hereof, from what they
are, in other intermediate ones. For these Parts, are like so many
White _Rays_, streaming, by the Diameter of the _Root_, from the inward
Edge toward the Circumference of the _Barque_; as in Lovage, Melilot,
Parsnep, &c. cut transversly, is apparent. ♦ _Tab. 8, 9._ ♦ They are,
though not in direct Lines, continued also by the length of the _Root_;
so that they are, as it were, so many _Membrances_, by which the other
Parts of the _Barque_, are disterminated.

8. §. The Continuation of these Diametral _Rays_, or _Portions_, is
divers: sometimes, but half through the _Barque_, or somewhat more,
or less, as in _Melilot_. ♦ _Tab. 9._ ♦ And it is probable, that to
the _Roots_ of all or most _Trefoyls_, and also of the _Leguminous_
Kind, this is proper, To have their Diametral _Rays_ come short of
the Circumference. ♦ _Tab. 8._ ♦ Sometimes, they run quite through to
the very _Skin_, as in _Lovage_. And I think, in the _Roots_ of all
Umbelliferous _Plants_: In which therefore, the _Skin_ seems to have
a closer Communion with the Diametral _Rays_, and to be originated
especially therefrom. They usually stand at an Equal Distance in
the same _Root_: But with respect to divers _Roots_, their Distance
varies; ♦ _Tab. 7, 8._ ♦ so less, in _Parsnep_, greater in _Bugloss_.
They are commonly Rectilinear, as in _Lovage_; ♦ _Tab. 8._ ♦ but
sometimes winding to and fro, as in a _Carrot_.

9. §. They are not always of one Size: in a _Carrot_ near the Inner
Edge of the _Barque_, exceeding Slender, and scarcely discernable; in
others, Thicker, as in the Three greater ones of _Melilot_, and in
common _Chervil_. ♦ _Tab. 8, 9._ ♦ Both by their Distance, and Size,
they are also less or more Numerous; some, only as they are nearer;
some, as smaller; others, as both. And ’tis proper, I think, to the
_Intybous_ kind, either to have none, or but a few. Sometimes they are
of the same Thickness quite, through the _Barque_ from edge to edge, as
in _Marsh-Mallow_. ♦ _Tab. 7._ ♦ And sometimes are considerably spread
or dilated as they aproach the _Skin_, wherewith they are joyned, and
whereinto they more visibly run, as in _Parsley_, or the smaller part
of the _Root_ of _Lovage_. ♦ _Tab. 8._ ♦ And in some _Roots_, as of
_Scorzonera_, at some times of the year, when less succulent, almost
the whole _Parenchyma_ seems to be of the Nature of the Diametral
_Rays_, in other _Roots_. The _Bladders_ of these Diametral _Portions_,
are sometimes, greater than those of the other _Parenchymous Parts_,
as in _Parsley_; and I think sometimes less. Yet as there, so here,
variously sized; to about six or eight Degrees; and those of _Parsley_
about the third, fourth, and fifth. Their Figure is Sometimes more
oblong; and their direction or respect more towards the Center of the
_Root_.

11. §. As the other _Parenchymous Parts_ of the _Barque_, are the
Receptacles of _Liquor_; so these, (where they are) of _Aer_. This
is argued, From their being more White, and not Transparent, as such
_Roots_ and _Parts_ use to be, which are more copiously and equally
filled up with _Liquor_: as the _Pith_ of _Elder_, which, in the old
_Stalks_, is White; was once, and by being well soaked, will become,
again Transparent. And from their being more dry and voyd of _Liquor_;
whereupon their _Bladders_, which cannot be Vacuities, must be filled
with more or less _Aer_, mixed with the _Sap_ or the _Vaporous_ parts
thereof. This is more observable in those Diametral _Portions_, which
terminate upon, and run into the _Skin_.


12. §. THE BARQUE is not only of a divers _Woof_, but as is said,
of a Compounded Substance; there being a certain number of _Lignous
Vessels_, fewer or more, in some place or other, mixed with the
_Parenchymous Part_ above described; and some way or other, are
demonstrable in all _Roots_. As by the Toughness of the _Barque_,
when pulled by the length. By the visible Continuation of the said
_Vessels_ through the length of the _Barque_, in the resemblance of
small _Threds_. ♦ _Tab. 6._ ♦ And by the rising up of the _Sap_ in
the traverse cut of the _Root_, in such places of the _Barque_, where
these _Threds_ terminate: as the existence of the same _Vessels_ in the
_Skin_, was proved in the _Precedent_ =Chapter=.

13. §. These Tubulary _Threds_, run not through the _Barque_ in direct
lines; but are frequently Braced together in the form of _Net-Work_;
The _Parenchymous Parts_ every where filling up the spaces betwixt the
Braced _Threds_; ♦ _Tab. 6._ ♦ as in _Burnet_, _Scorzonera_, &c. the
_Barque_ being paired or striped off, is apparent.

14. §. They seem, at first, where they are Braced, to be Inosculated;
so as to be pervious one into another. But a more accurate view,
especially assisted by a _Microscope_, discovers the contrary. Neither
are they woun’d any way one about another, as Threds are in a Rope:
nor Implicated, as in ravled Yarn, or the Knots of a Net: but only
contiguous or simply Tangent, as the several Chords in the Braces of
a Drum: being thus joyned together by the _Parenchymous Parts_, as in
speaking of the _Pith_, will be understood how. Yet do not always the
same _Threds_ belong and keep entire to one _Brace_; but are frequently
parted into lesser _Threds_; which are transposed from _Brace_ to
_Brace_. Nor do they always, in whole or in part, presently after
their contingence, mutually fall off again; but, oftentimes, run along
collaterally joyned together for some space.

♦ _Tab. 6._ ♦ 15. §. These _Braces_ are of various number in divers
_Roots_; more frequent in _Jerusalem Artichoke_, less in _Scorzonera_,
more rare in _Cumfry_. The _Threds_ likewise are variously Divaricated;
sometimes more, where the _Braces_ are frequent, as in _Jerusalem
Artichoke_; and sometimes less, where the _Braces_ are rare, as in
_Scorzonera_, _Dandelion_: And in all _Roots_, more frequent towards
the Inner Verge of the _Bark_.

16. §. By what is said, it is partly implied, That these _Threds_,
are not Single _Vessels_; but a _Cluster_ of them, Twenty, Thirty,
or more or fewer of them together. Yet as the _Threds_ are not
Inosculated in the _Braces_; so neither are the _Vessels_, in the
_Threds_. Nor yet Twisted; but only stand collateral together; as the
several Single _Threds_ of the _Silkworm_, do in Sleave-Silk. Neither
are these _Vessels_ pyramidal, so far as the _Glass_ will discover;
or, from probable Reason, may be conjectured. Nor Ramified, so as
to be successively propagated one from another, after the manner of
the _Veins_ in _Animals_: but Cylindrical, and Distinctly continued,
throughout the length of the _Root_; as the several _Fibres_ in a
_Tendon_ or _Nerve_.


17. §. THESE VESSELS are either themselves of divers kinds, or serve,
at least, to constitute divers Kinds, in divers _Roots_: of the
different Natures whereof, although there may be other ways whereby
to judge; yet so far as by Inspection, we may do it, chiefly, by the
Diversity of those _Liquors_, which they severally contain. Sometimes
they yield a _Lympha_; and that Thin, as they do in a _Parsnep_;
especially those that make a _Ring_, at the inward extremity of the
_Bark_. See the Root it self. That this Clear _Sap_ ascendeth only from
these _Vessels_, is certain. Because no _Liquor_ will do the like, from
any _Parenchymous Part_, as _Chap. 2._ hath been said. And because it
is of a different nature from the _Sap_ contained in the _Bladders_
of the _Parenchyma_; although of the same _Colour_, yet sensibly more
_Sweet_.

18. §. Sometimes they yield a Thick and Mucilaginous _Lympha_, as in
_Cumfry_, as appeareth by its tenacity. From the Mucilaginous _Content_
of these _Vessels_ it is, I suppose, that the _Sap_ contained in the
_Bladders_ is rendred of the like nature, so far as it approaches
hereto, which sometimes is more, as in _Marsh-mallow_; and sometimes
but little as in _Borage_: For in pressing out the _Liquor_ of this
_Plant_, and then heating it over an indifferent fire; the far greater
part hereof remaineth thin; only some certain strings and little bits
of a gellied substance are mixed herewith; which as it seems, were
originally the proper _Liquor_ of these _Muciducts_.

19. §. Oftentimes these Succiferous _Vessels_ yield a _Milky_ or White
_Sap_; and sometimes Yellow, and of other colours as in _Sonchus_,and
most _Cichoraceous Plants_; in _Angelica_, and most _Umbelliferous_;
in _Burdock_, and divers _Thistles_, to which that is ’akin: in
_Scorzonera_, _Common Bells_, and many other _Plants_, not commonly
taken notice of to be _milky_. The _Milky Saps_ of all which, although
they differ in Colour, Thickness, and other Qualities; yet agree,
in being more _Oyly_ than any of the _Lymphous Saps_. It being the
mixture of the _Oyly_ parts with some other Limpid _Liquor_, but of
a different Nature, which causeth them to be of a _Milky_, or other
_Opacous_ Colour, in the same manner as common _Oyl_, and a strong
_Liquamen_ of Tartar, shaked in a Bottle together, presently mix into a
White _Liquor_. And although they will, for the greatest part, separate
again; yet some of their parts, without any Boiling, or so much as the
least Digestion with Heat, by Agitation only, or standing together
for some time, incorporate in the form of a Thin _Milky-Sope_, which
will also dissolve in _Water_. I suppose, therefore, That it is the
_Volatile Salt_, chiefly, of these _Plants_, which being mixed with
their _Oyl_, renders this _Liquor_ of a White or other Opacous Colour.

20. §. Sometimes the _Oyl_ will separate and discover it self: for
if you cut a _Fenil-Root_ traverse, after it hath layn some days out
of the Ground; the same _Vessels_, which, in a fresh _Root_, yields
_Milk_; will now, yield Oyl: the watery parts of the _Milk_, which in
the drying of the _Root_ are more evaporable, being spent.

21. §. All _Gums_ and _Balsams_ are likewise to be reputed the proper
_Contents_ of these _Vessels_: for These and _Milks_, are very near
akin. So the _Milk_ of _Fenil_, upon standing, turns to a Clear
_Balsam_; of _Scorzonera_, _Dandelion_, and others, to a _Gum_. In the
dryed _Root_ of _Angelica_, &c. being split, the _Milk_, according to
the Continuation of these _Vessels_, appeareth, as Blood clodders in
the _Veins_, condensed to an hard and shining _Rosin_. ♦ _Tab. 9._
♦ And the _Root_ of _Helenium_ cut transversely, presently yields a
curious _Balsame_ of a Citrine Colour, and sometimes of the Colour of
_Balsame_ of _Sulphur_. I call it a _Balsame_; because it will not
dissolve in Water. Yet not a _Terebinth_; because, nothing near so
viscid or tenaceous as that is. But the _Root_ of Common _Wormwood_,
bleeds, from large _Vessels_, a true _Terebinth_, ♦ _Tab. 10._ E. ♦ or
a _Balsame_ with all the defining properties of a _Terebinth_; although
that word be commonly used only for the Liquors of some _Trees_.

22. §. There is yet another kind of _Sap-Vessels_, which may be
called _Vapour-Vessels_; as in _Docks_, at least some of them. For by
the _Sap-Vessels_ it is, that the _Barques_ of _Roots_ do _Bleed_.
Of which, some Bleed quick and plentifully, as the _Umbelliferous_
and the _Cichoraceous_ Kinds. Some, very slowly and scarce visibly,
as all or most _Trefoyls_, and of the _Leguminous_ Kind. And some
seem not to _Bleed_, as the _Dock_. Yet that this _Root_, hath also
_Vessels_ distinct from those that carry _Aer_; doth partly appear,
from the different Colour they produce where they stand; as will better
be understood anon, in speaking of the Causes of the _Colours_ of
_Roots_. As also from the Toughness of the _Barque_, in pulling it by
the length; neither the _Parenchyma_, nor the _Aer-Vessels_, being of
themselves _Tough_. But because the _Succus_ or _Sap_ they carry, seems
to be a kind of Dewy _Vapour_, therefore, they may not improperly be
called _Roriferous_ or _Vapour-Vessels_.


23. §. THE _Sap-Vessels_, are not only of divers Kinds, in divers
_Roots_, but in the same. Whether in all, I doubt: but in some it
is certain they are: ♦ _Tab. 9._ ♦ For if you cut a _Fenil-Root_
traverse, both _Milk_ and _Limpid Sap_, will presently ascend, and,
upon accurate inspection, appear thereupon distinctly. So the _Roots_,
both of _Trachelium_ and _Enula_, Bleed both a _Lympha_, and a Citrine
_Balsame_: and _Wormwood_, both a _Lympha_, and a _Terebinth_, at the
same time. So also the _Root_ of _Dandelion_ being cut in _November_,
seems to bleed both a _Milk_ and a _Lympha_; the latter being drowned
by the former at another time when it is more copious. Whether all
_Roots_ have _Lymphæducts_, is doubtful; but ’tis most probable, that
they have, more or fewer; standing, for the most part, in a _Ring_, at
the Inner Verge of the _Barque_: the _Sap_ whereof, I suppose, is so
far of common Nature in all _Roots_, as to be Clear, and less Oily.


24. §. THE Quantity of these _Vessels_ is very different: In _Borage_,
_Peony_, _Bistort_, but few; in _Asparagus_, fewer: in _Parsnep_,
_Celandine_, many; in _Fenil_, _Marsh-mallow_, many more: and
betwixt these extreams, there are many Degrees, ♦ _Tab. 7, 8, 9._ ♦
as by comparing the _Roots_ of _Horse-Radish_, _Turnep_, _Briony_,
_Skirrets_, _Parsley_, _Goats-Beard_, and as many more as you please,
may be seen. Amongst the several Sorts of _Docks_, they seem in
_Patience_, to be the fewest; in _Red-Dock_, the most numerous. There
are two ways of judging of their Number; Either as their Extremeties
are visible upon the traverse cut of the _Barque_; or as the _Barque_
is diversly Brittle or Tough; being so, from the various Number of
these _Vessels_ therein, as in the _Second Chapter_ hath been said.

25. §. The Quantity of the ascending _Sap_, is a doubtful argument,
whether of the Number, or Size of these _Vessels_. For it is common to
most _Milky-Roots_, for the _Milk_ to ascend more copiously: yet in
some of them, the _Vessels_ seem, in proportion with the _Parenchymous
Part_, not to be so numerous, as in some other _Roots_, where the
ascending _Sap_ is less; as by comparing the _Lacteals_ of _Dandelion_,
and the _Lymphæducts_ of _Fenil_ together, may appear: so that it
should seem, that the bore of the _Lacteal Vessels_, is greater than
that of the _Lymphæducts_.


26. §. THE Situation of these _Vessels_, as they appear, even to the
naked Eye, in the transverse Section, is Various and Elegant. Sometimes
they are posited only at the Inner Edg of the _Barque_, where they make
a Ring, as in _Asparagus_. ♦ _Tab. 7, 8, 9, & 10._ ♦ In which place and
position, they stand in most, if not in all, _Roots_, how variouslly
soever they are posited also otherwise. The Common _Crow-Foot_ with
numerous _Roots_, hath a _Ring_ of _Sap-Vessels_ next the _Skin_. So
the _Barque_ of _Monks-Hood_, is encompassed with a transparent _Ring_
of _Sap-Vessels_. The _Ring_ is either more Entire, as in _Eryngo_,
_Brown-Wort_, _Valerian_, _Hop_, _Madder_, _&c._ Or it is a Prick’d
_Ring_, as in _Buttyr-Bur_. Sometimes they are chiefly postur’d in a
Prick-Ring, towards the outward part of the _Barque_, as in _Peony_:
and some _Roots_ are pricked all over the _Barque_, as of _Melilot_. In
others, they stand not so much in Pricks, as Portions or _Colums_, as
in _Cumfry_.

27. §. In others, again, they all stand in more continued Lines, either
Rays or Diametral, as in _Borage_; or Peripherial, as in _Celandine_.
The _Vascular_ Rays are not equally extended in all _Roots_: in
_Parsnep_, towards the Circumference of the _Barque_; ♦ _Tab. 7, 8,
9._ ♦ in _Bugloss_, about half way. In all _Docks_, and _Sorrels_, the
_Rays_ are extended through about ¾ of the thickness of the _Barque_,
towards the Circumference, whereabout, divers of them are always
_arched_ in, two and two together. In all or many _Trefoyls_, and of
the _Leguminous_ Kind, they are extended through no more than ⅓ᵈ of
the _Barque_. In the _Umbelliferous_, they are Ralled in betwixt the
Diametral _Portions_ of the _Parenchyma_. In _Borage_, the Rays are
more Continuous; in a _Carrot_, more Pricked. Here also the Pricks
stand in Even Lines; in _Lovage_, they are Divaricated. Of which, and
those of some other _Roots_, it is also Observable, That they are not
all meer Pricks, but most of them small, yet real Circles; ♦ _Tab.
8._ ♦ which, after the _Milk_ hath been frequently licked off, and
ceaseth to ascend, are visible, even without a _Glass_. And note, that
in observing all _Milk-Vessels_, the _Milk_ is to be taken off, not
with the Finger but the Tongue; so often, till it riseth no more, or
but little. And some _Roots_ may also be soaked in Water; whereby the
Position of the _Milk-Vessels_, will be visible by the darker Colour of
the _Barque_, where they stand.

28. §. The Rays sometimes, run more Parallel, and keep several, as in
_Monkshood_; and sometimes, towards the Circumference of the _Barque_,
they are occurrent; ♦ _Tab. 7, 8, 9._ ♦ as not only in _Docks_,
but other _Plants_: In _Eryngo_, in a termination more Circular;
and in _Bryony_, angular, or in the form of a _Glory_, as also in
_Horsradish_, through a _Microscope_. ♦ _Tab. 15._ ♦ The Peripherial
Lines are in some, more entire Circles, as in _Dandelion_; in others,
made up of shorter Chords, as in _Potato_, _Cumfry_, and the smaller
part of the _Root_ of _Monks-hood_. In some, the Pricks are so
exceeding small, and stand so close, that, to the bare eye, they seem
to be continuous _Rings_, which yet, through the _Microscope_, appear
distinct, as in _Marsh-mallow_ and _Liquirish_. ♦ _Tab. 12._ ♦

29. §. Sometimes Columns and Chords are compounded, as in _Burnet_;
Pricks and Chords, in _Potato_; Rays and Rings, in _Monkshood_; where
the Ring is Single. In _Fenil_, there is a double or treble order
both of Rays and Rings, the _Lymphæducts_ standing in Rays and the
_Lacteals_ in Rings. And in _Marsh-mallow_, the _Vessels_ are so
posited as to make both those kinds of Lines at once.

30. §. In _Celandine_, they seem all, to the bare eye, to stand in
numerous Rings lying even one within another. As also in _Dandelion_;
in which yet, being viewed through a _Microscope_, ♦ _Tab. 13._ ♦ there
is an appearance of very many small Rays; which streaming from the
Inner Verge of the _Barque_, cross three or four of the smaller Rings,
and are there terminated. Whence it should seem that _Lymphatick_ Rays
and _Milky_ Rings, are in that _Root_, so far mixed together. Only the
_Lympha_, being confounded with the _Milk_, cannot be discerned. And
where the _Milky-Vessels_ are evacuated, or at such Seasons, wherein
they are less full, divers _Milky Roots_ will yield a clear _Liquor_ at
the Inner Verge of the _Barque_, where, at other times, they seem to
yield only _Milk_. And this is the Description of the _Barque_.




                                CHAP. IV.

                             _Of the WOOD._


THAT Portion of the _Root_ which standeth next within the _Barque_, and
in _Trees_, and _Shrubby Plants_, is the _Wood_; is also compounded
of Two Substantially different Bodies, _Parenchymous_ and _Lignous_.
The _Parenchymous_, is of the same Substantial Nature with that of the
_Barque_. And is originated from it; being not only adjacent to it, but
all round about continuous therewith; even as that, is with the _Skin_;
the _Parenchyma_ of the _Barque_, being distributed, from time to time,
partly outward into the _Skin_, and partly inward, into the _Wood_.

2. §. The Position of the several parts hereof, is different. For
the most part it hath a Diametral Continuation, in several Portions,
running betwixt as many more of the _Lignous_, from the Circumference
towards the Center of the _Root_: all together, constituting that,
which in the _Second Chapter_ of the _First_ =Book=, I call the
_Insertment_. In the _Roots_ of many _Herbs_, these Diametral or
Inserted Portions are more observable, as in _Cumfry_; ♦ _Tab. 9._ ♦
which leadeth to the notice of them in all others, both of _Herbs_ and
_Trees_. Sometimes part of this _Parenchymous_ Body is disposed into
_Rings_, as in _Fenil_. The Number and Size of which Rings differ:
In _Fenil_, when the _Root_ is grown large, they are in some places
broader, but fewer; ♦ _Tab. 8, 9._ ♦ in _Beet_ they are narrower, but
more. The Diametral Portions are here, in like manner, much varied;
in _Cumfry_, _Celandine_, larger; in _Beet_, _Bugloss_, meaner; in
_Borage_, _Parsnep_, more, and smaller; and in most Woody-_Roots_,
streaming betwixt the _Pith_ and the _Barque_, as so many small Rays.
Their Continuation is also different; in some _Roots_, to the Centre,
as in _Columbine_; in others not, as in _Parsnep_. ♦ _Tab. 17._ ♦ And
sometimes different in the same _Root_, as in the _Vine_.

3. §. The Contexture of these _Parenchymous_ Portions is sometimes
Uniform, as in _Bugloss_, _Peony_; and sometimes also, as it is in the
_Barque_, different; in part, more sappy, and transparent; in part,
more white, dry, and aery, as in _Carrot_, _Lovage_, _Scorzonera_, and
others; which yet cannot be observed without a wary view. But their
general Texture is the same being all made up of many small _Bladders_.
Which are here of different Sizes, like those of the _Barque_, but for
the most part smaller. Their Shape likewise, is usually Round; but
sometimes Oblong and Oval, as in _Borage_; or Oblong and Square, as in
the _Vine_. ♦ _Tab. 17._ ♦

4. §. The _Lignous Part_, if not always, yet usually, is also
Compounded of Two Kinds of _Bodies_, _scil._ _Succiferous_ or
_Lignous_ and _Aer-Vessels_. The _Lignous_ as far as discernable, are
of the same Conformation and Nature with those of the _Barque_, and
in the transverse cut of the _Root_, do oftentimes, as those, emit
a _Liquor_. They are also Braced; and many of them run in distinct
_Threds_ or Portions, collaterally together.

5. §. The _Aer Vessels_ I so call, because they contain no _Liquor_,
but an _Aery Vapour_. They are, more or less, visible in all _Roots_.
They may be distinguished, to the bare Eye, from the _Parenchymous
Parts_, by their Whiter Surface; and their standing more prominent,
wheras those shrink below the transverse level of the _Root_, upon
drying. They are frequently Conjugated divers of them together,
sometimes fewer, and for the most part single, as in _Asparagus_; ♦
_Tab. 10, & 15._ ♦ sometimes many, as in _Hors-Radish_. And their
Conjugations are also Braced, as the Threds of the _Succiferous
Vessels_. But they are no where Inosculated: nor Twisted one about
another; but only Tangent or Collateral. Neither are they Ramified, the
greater into less; but are all distinctly continued, as the _Nerves_ in
_Animals_, from one end of the _Root_ to the other.

6. §. Their Braces, as those of the _Succiferous Vessels_, are also of
various number: in _Jerusalem Artichoke_, _Cumfry_, _Scorzonera_, more
rare; in _Borage_, _Burnet_, more frequent; as by stripping off the
_Barque_ of such _Roots_, where it is easily separable, may be seen.
♦ _Tab. 6._ ♦ And they often vary in the same _Root_; so in _Borage_,
_Scorzonera_, &c. they are more frequent in the Centre, and next the
_Barque_, than in the Intermediate space, as by splitting those _Roots_
down the middle doth appear. ♦ _Tab. 6._ ♦ They also vary from those
of the _Succiferous Vessels_; those being usually more frequent, as in
_Jerusalem Artichoke_, than these of the _Aerial_.

7. §. Betwixt these Braced _Aer-Vessels_, and the rest, which make the
true _Wood_, run the _Parenchymous Parts_ above described; ♦ _Tab. 6._
♦ as they do betwixt the _Succiferous_ in the _Barque_: and so make up
two Pieces of _Net Work_, wherof one is the filling up of the other.

8. §. The Position of both these Kinds of _Vessels_, is Various. The
_Succiferous_ or _Lignous_, are sometimes posited in diametral lines or
portions; as in the _Vine_, and most _Trees_. ♦ _Tab. 17._ ♦ Sometimes,
oppositely to the _Aerial_, as in _Beet_; ♦ _Tab. 8._ ♦ each Ring herein
being double, and made both of _Sap-_ and _Aer-Vessels_.

9. §. In _Nettle_ the Position is very peculiar, ♦ _Tab. 8._ ♦ from
what it is in the _Roots_ of other _Herbs_; being curiously mixed; the
_Succiferous_ running cross the _Aerial_, in several, _viz._ _Five_,
_Six_, _Seven_, or more _Rings_. In _Bryony_ the several Conjugations
of the _Aerial_, are distinctly surrounded with the _Succiferous_. ♦
_Tab. 7._ ♦ In _Patience_, the _Succiferous_ are disposed, besides
Rays, into many small Rings, of different Sizes, sprinkled up and down,
and not, as in other _Roots_ having one common Centre; within divers
whereof, the _Aer-Vessels_ are included: especially within those which
are drawn, not into _Rings_, but, as it were, into little stragling
_Hedges_.

10. §. That also of the _Aer-Vessels_, is Various and Elegant: especially
in the upper part of the _Root_. In _Ammi_, _Lilium-non-bulbosom_, they
make a Ring. In these, a Prick’d-Ring; in _Peony_, a Ring of Rays; in
_Valerian_, a Ring of Pricks and Rays. ♦ _Tab. 7, 8, 9._ ♦ In others,
they make not Rings, but longer Rays, extended either towards the
Centre, as in _Scorzonera_; or meeting in it, as in _Columbine_. In the
Common _Dock_, they stand more in single Rays: in the other _Species_
of _Docks_, both in Rays, and collateral Conjugations between.

11. §. In _Beet_, they stand in several Rings; and every Ring, made
of Rays. In _Cumfry_, the Rays and Rings are separate; those stand
without, these next the Centre. ♦ _Tab. 8, 9._ ♦ In _Dandelion_, they
stand altogether, and make a little Rope, in the Center it self. In
_Geranium_, and others of that Kindred, they make a little Thred, in
the same place. And in _Skirret_, they stand in two Threds, near the
Centre.

12. §. In _Celandine_, they stand in almost parallel Lines. ♦ _Tab.
8, 9._ ♦ In _Monks-hood_, of a wedged Figure; divided in the smaller
part of the _Root_, into Three little Wedges, with their poynts meeting
exactly in the Centre. In _Cincquefoyle_, and _Strawberry_, they are
also postur’d in three Conjugations, triangularly. In the young _Roots_
of _Oak_, they stand neither in Radiated, nor otherwise strait, but
Winding Lines. And in _Borage_ the position, of many of them, is
Spiral. As likewise, sometimes, in _Mercury_, or _Lapathum unctuosum_.
♦ _Tab. 15._ ♦ In _Horse-Radish_, they stand more confused neither in
Rings nor in Rays; yet their several Conjugations, are radiated: with
very many other differences.

13. §. The Quantity of these _Vessels_, as to the space they take up
in the _Root_, is to be computed Two ways, By their Number, and Size.
Their Number may, in some _Roots_, and in some measure, be judged of,
by the bare Eye; having, frequently, a whiter surface than the other
_Parts_. As also their Size; the Bore of these _Vessels_ being greater
than that of the _Lignous_ in all _Roots_; especially in some. For if
you take the _Roots_ of _Vine_, _Fenil_, _Dandelion_, _Plum-tree_,
_Elder_, _Willow_, &c. and lay them by, for some time, to dry; and
then, having cut off a very thin Slice of each, transversely; if you
hold up those Slices before your Eye, so as the Light may be trajected
through the said _Vessels_, they hereby become visible, as notably
different, both in Number and Size.

14. §. But undeceitful and accurate Observation of both their Number,
and Size, must be made by the _Microscope_; and so they will appear to
be much more various. In _Bistort_, _Skirret_, they are very few; in
_Beet_, very many: betwixt which extreams there are all Degrees; as
in _Orpine_, _Venus Looking-Glass_, _Scorzonera_, Great _Celandine_,
_Peony_, _Borage_, _Fenil_, &c. may be seen. So their Size, in some is
extream small, as in _Strawberry_, _Bistort_, _Valerian_; in others
very great, as in _Asparagus_, _Bugloss_, _Vine_. They are also of
several Sizes in one and the same Numerical _Root_; but in some, are
less varied, as in _Lilium non bulbosum_, _Asparagus_, _Bugloss_; in
others, more, as in _Bryony_, _Lovage_. ♦ _Tab. 10. to 17._ ♦ Amongst
all _Roots_, they vary by about Twenty Degrees; as by comparing the
_Roots_ of _Vine_, _Thorn-Apple_, _Bryony_, _Lovage_, _Fenil_, Wild
_Carrot_, _Saxifrage_, _Parsley_, _Peony_, _Hore-hound_, _Cinquefoyl_,
_Strawberry_, &c. together, may be seen. Some of those in the _Vine_,
being of the greatest Size; appearing through a good _Glass_, at least
one Third of an Inch in Diametre: those in _Strawberry_, and that
Kind, of the smallest; most of them appearing, in the same _Glass_,
no bigger, than to admit the poynt of a small Pin, according to the
Standard, in _Tab. 12._ See also the Figures of so many of them as are
drawn.

15. §. In some _Roots_, they are Small, and Few; as in _Jerusalem
Artichoke_; in others Small, but Many, as in _Horse-Radish_: ♦ _Tab.
11, 14, 15, 17._ ♦ in _Bugloss_, they are Great, but Few; in the
_Vine_, Great and Many. So that the proportion, which those of a
_Vine_, their Number and Size being taken together, bear to those of
_Jerusalem Artichoke_, may be, at least, as Fifty, to One. Of the
smallest Kinds, as those of _Cinquefoyl_, _Jerusalem Artichoke_, and
the like; It is to be noted, That they are scarce ever visible in the
fresh Slices of these _Roots_; but after they have layn by a while, at
last, by a good _Glass_, Clear Light, and steddy View, are discernable.

16. §. In some _Roots_, the greater of these _Vessels_ stand in or next
the Centre, ♦ _Tab. 13, 15._ ♦ as in _Taraxacum_, or _Dandelion_; in
others next the circumference, as in _Horse-Radish_. Sometimes each
of them is from one end of the _Root_ to the other, of a more equal
Size, or more Cylindrical, as in _Marsh-mallow_; but usually, they
widen, more or less, from the Top, to the Bottom of the _Root_, as in
_Thorn-Apple_: about the Top of which, they are, for the most part,
but of the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth, Magnitude; some of the Fifth,
but none of the Third; but about the Bottome, they are most of the
Third, and Fifth: whence it is manifest, That some of them are, in
the manner of _Veins_, somewhat Pyramidal. Yet is it observable, That
their ampliation proceedeth not towards, but from their Original, as in
_Nerves_.

17. §. Of these _Vessels_ Seignior _Malpighi_ hath observed;
_Componuntur_ (saith he) _expositæ fistulæ Zona tenui & pellucida,
velut argentei coloris lamina, parum lata; quæ, spiraliter locata,
& extremis lateribus unita, Tubum, interius & exterius aliquantulum
asperum, efficit._

18. §. To whose Observation I further add, That the _Spiral Zone_,
or _Lamina_, as he calls it, is not ever one Single _Piece_; but
consisteth of Two or More round and true _Fibres_, although standing
collaterally together, yet perfectly distinct. Neither are these Single
_Fibres_ themselves _flat_, like a _Zone_; but of a _round_ forme,
like a most fine _Thred_. According as fewer or more of these _Fibres_
happen to break off, from their Spiral location, together; the _Zone_
is narrower, or broader: usually, Narrower in the _Trunk_, and Broader
in the _Root_.

19. §. Of these _Fibres_ I also Observe, That they are not
_Inosculated_ side to side, but are _Knit_ together by other smaller
_Fibres_; those being, as it were, the _Warp_, and these the _Woof_ of
the _Aer-Vessels_. Yet I think the several _Fibres_ are not interwoven
just as in a _Web_; but by a kind of Stitch, as the several _Plates_ or
_Bredths_ of a Floor-Mat. A clear and elegant sight of these _Fibres_,
and of their _Interweftage_, by splitting a _Vine-Root_, or a piece
of _Oak_, may, with a good _Glass_ in the sides of their Greater
_Aer-Vessels_, be obtained; having much of the resemblance of _Close
Needle-work_.

20. §. The Spiration of the _Fibres_ of these _Vessels_, may more
easily be observed in the _Trunk_, than in the _Root_. And better
in younger _Plants_, than other. And not so well by Cutting as by
Splitting, or by Tearing off some small Piece, through which they
_run_: their Conformation being, by this means, not spoiled. Yet this
way, the _Vessels_ are seen, chiefly, _Unresolved_.

21. §. But in the _Leaves_ and Tender _Stalks_ of all such _Plants_,
as shew, upon breaking, a kind of _Doune_ or _Wool_; they may be seen
_Resolved_ and Drawn out, and that some times even to the naked Eye,
an Inch or two Inches in length. This _Wool_ being nothing else, but
a certain number of _Fibres_ Resolved from their Spiral position in
these _Vessels_, and Drawn out in Length; and so clustred together,
as so many _Threds_ or little _Ropes_: appearing thus more or less,
in the _Leaves_ and some other _Parts_ of most _Plants_; but more
remarquably in some, as in the _Vine_, _Scabious_, and others. As also
in the Scales of a _Squill_. In which last, for example, they are so
easily separable, as further to shew, what before was observed; _viz._
That the _Plate_ or _Zone_, into which the _Aer-Vessels_ are usually
Resolved, is not one Single Piece, or meer _Plate_; but made up of
several Round _Fibres_, all standing and running parallel, and so knit
together by other smaller ones, tranversly, in the form of a _Zone_.
For if you break or cut a _Leaf_ or _Shell_ of a fresh _Squill_, till
you come to the _Aer-Vessels_, and having softly drawn them out, for
about an Inch or more (to the naked Eye) in length, you then single
out one or two of them from the rest, and rowl them, as they hang at
the _Shell_, eight or nine times round, each _Vessel_ will appear,
through a _Glass_, to consist of 8, 10, or 12 small _Fibres_; which,
in the Unresolved _Vessel_, run parallel; but by this means, are all
separated one from another. See the _Figures_ belonging to the _Third_
and _Fourth_ =Books=.

22. §. The Process of their Spiration, is not, so far as I have
observed, accidental, but constantly the same; _scil._ In the _Root_,
by _South_, from _West_ to _East_: But in the _Trunk_, contrarily, by
_South_, from _East_ to _West_.

23. §. The _Content_ of these _Vessels_, is, as hath already been
intimated, more _Aery_. The Arguments for which, are, That upon a
transverse Cut of the _Root_, the _Sap_ ascendeth not there, where
These stand. Being also viewed through a _Microscope_, they are never
observed to be filled with _Liquor_. Besides a _Root_ cut and immersed
in Water, till the Water is in some part got into these _Vessels_, and
then the _Root_ taken out and crushed; the other _Parts_ will yield
_Liquor_, but These, only _Bubbles_: which _Bubbles_ are made, by some
small quantity of _Liquor_ mixed with the _Aer_, before contained in
the said _Vessels_. To which, other Arguments will arise out of those
Things that follow in the _Second_ =Part=. As also for this _Content_,
its not being a pure or simple, but _Vaporous Aer_. Whether these
_Vessels_ may not, in some _Vegetables_, and at some times, contain
_Liquor_, is doubtful.[2] Thus far of the _Lignous Part_.

     [2] See _Book 3_.




                                CHAP. V.

                             _Of the PITH._


WITHIN the _Lignous Part_ lyeth the _Pith_. This _Part_ is not common
to all _Roots_, for some have none, as _Nicotian_, _Stramonium_, and
others. Yet many which have none, or but little, throughout all their
lower parts, have one fair enough about their tops, as _Mallow_,
_Bourage_, _Dandelion_, and the like. ♦ _Tab. 6._ ♦ See the _Roots_.
And in many others there are _Parenchymous Parts_, of the same
substantial nature with the _Pith_, distributed betwixt the several
Rings of _Vessels_, and every where visible, from the top to the
bottom, as in _Beet_, _Fenil_, &c. ♦ _Tab. 8._ ♦

2. §. The Size of the _Pith_ is varied by many Degrees, easily
reckoned an Hundred; in _Fenil_, _Dandelion_, _Asparagus_, but small;
in _Horse-Radish_, _Valerian_, _Bistort_, great. The Shape hereof,
in the lower parts of most _Roots_, is Pyramidal; but at the tops,
Various, according to the different Distribution of the _Vessels_, as
in _Carrot_, _Hyperbolick_, in _Parsley_, _Oval_; ♦ _Tab. 6._ ♦ as
appeareth, in cutting the _Roots_ length-ways.

3. §. The _Pith_, for the most part, especially in _Trees_, is a
_Simple_ Body: but sometimes, it is, as the _Barque_, compounded; some
certain number of _Succiferous Vessels_ being mixed herewith; as in
_Jerusalem Artichoke_, ♦ _Tab. 6, & 8._ ♦ _Horse-Radish_, &c. upon a
traverse cut, by a strict view, may be discerned. Their Position is
sometimes Confused, as in a _Carrot_; and sometimes Regular, as in
_Parsley_; appearing, by the traverse cut, in Rings, and in cutting
by the length, in Arches. ♦ _Tab. 6._ ♦ And sometimes the _Pith_ is
hollow; as in the _Level-Roots_ of _Bishops-Weed_: these _Roots_
being made out of the _Stalk_, ♦ _§. 13, 14, 15._ ♦ as in the _First_
=Chapter= hath been shewed, how.

4. §. As all the other Parts of the _Root_, are originated from the
_Seed_; so, sometimes, is the _Pith_ it self. But sometimes, it hath
its more immediate Derivation from the _Barque_. Hence it is, that many
_Roots_, which have no _Pith_ in their lower parts, have one at their
top, as _Columbine_, _Lovage_, &c. ♦ _Tab. 4._ ♦ For the _Parenchymous
Parts_ of the _Barque_ being, by degrees, distributed into Diametral
_Portions_, running betwixt those of the _Lignous Body_, and at length,
meeting and uniting in the Centre, they thus constitute the _Pith_.
In the same manner, at the top of some _Roots_, the _Pith_ is either
made or augmented, out of the _Parenchymous Rings_ above described;
these being gradually distributed to, and embodied in the Centre; as in
_Fenil_, and some other _Roots_, their lower and upper parts compared
together, maybe seen. Even as in _Animals_, one _Part_, as the _Dura
Mater_, is the original of divers others.

5. §. From hence, it also appears, That the _Pith_ is of the same
Substantial Nature with the _Parenchyma_ of the _Barque_, and with
the Diametral _Portions_; and that therefore they are all one body,
differing in no Essential Property, but only in their Shape and Place.
The same is also evident from the Continuity of the _Pith_ with the
Diametral _Portions_, as of These, with the said _Parenchyma_. And from
their Contexture, which, by a _Microscope_, appeareth to be of one and
the same general kind, in all _Plants_, both in the _Parenchyma_ of
the _Barque_, in the _Insertment_ or Diametral _Portions_, and in the
_Pith_, all being made up of _Bladders_.

♦ _Tab. 9, & 15._ ♦ 6. §. The _Bladders_ of the _Pith_, are of very
different Sizes; seldom less, than in the _Barque_, as in _Asparagus_;
usually much bigger, as in _Horse-Radish_. They may be well reckoned to
about fifteen or twenty degrees; those in _Jerusalem Artichoke_, of the
largest; in _Valerian_, _Horse-Radish_, of the meaner; in _Bistort_,
_Peony_, of the smallest. Their Position is rarely varied, as it is
oftentimes, in the _Barque_; but more uniform, and in the transverse
Cut, equally respective to all parts of the _Root_: yet being piled
evenly, one over another, in the long cut, they seem to run, in Direct
Trains, by the length of the _Root_. Their Shape also is, usually more
orbicular; ♦ _Tab. 11._ ♦ but sometimes, somewhat angular, in the larger
kinds, as in _Jerusalem Artichoke_.


7. §. THUS FAR the Contexture of the _Pith_ is well discoverable in the
_Root_. In the _Trunk_, farther, and more easily. Whereof therefore,
in the next _Book_, I shall give a more particular _Description_ and
_Draught_. Yet since I am speaking of it, I shall not wholly omit
here to observe, That the _Sides_, by which the aforesaid _Bladders_
of the _Pith_ are circumscribed, are not meer _Paper-Skins_, or rude
_Membranes_; but so many several Ranks or Piles of exceeding small
_Fibrous Threds_; lying, for the most part, evenly one over another,
from the bottom to the top of every _Bladder_; and running cross, as
the _Threds_ in the Weavers _Warp_, from one _Bladder_ to another.
Which is to say, That the _Pith_ is nothing else but a _Rete mirabile_,
or an Infinite Number of _Fibres_ exquisitely small, and admirably
Complicated together: as by cutting the _Pith_ with a _Razor_, and
so viewing it with a good _Glass_, may be seen. See the _Figures_
belonging to the _Third_ =Book=.

8. §. All _Plants_ exhibit this Spectable, not alike distinctly;
those best, with the largest _Bladders_. Nor the same _Pith_, in
any condition; but best, when dry: Because then, the _Sap_ being
voided, the spaces betwixt the _Fibrous Threds_, and so the _Threds_
themselves, are more distinctly discernable. Yet is it not to be dryed,
after Cutting; Because its several parts, will thereupon coincide and
become deformed. But to be chosen, while the _Plant_ is yet growing;
at which time, it may be often found dry, yet undeformed; as in the
_Trunks_ of _Common Thistle_, _Jerusalem Artichoke_, &c.

9. §. Neither are these _Threds_, so far as I can observe, Single
_Fibres_; but usually, consist of several together. Nor are they
_simply_ Collateral, but by the weftage of other _Fibres_, in their
natural Estate, knit together; much after the same manner as the
_Spiral Fibres_ of the _Aer-Vessels_. This Connexion I have no
where so well seen, as in the White _Bottoms_ of the _Bladders_ of a
_Bulrush_, being cut traverse; wherein they have the appearance, of
very Fine and close _Needle-work_.

10. §. The _Fibres_ by which the said _Threds_ are knit together, I
think are all Single: and are seldom and scarcely visible, except by
obliquely Tearing the _Pith_; by which means, they will appear through
the Glass, broken off, sometimes, a quarter or half an Inch, or an Inch
in Length; and as small as one Single _Thred_ of a _Spiders Webb_. In
a _Bulrush_, they are sometimes discernable in cutting by the Length.
These _Fibres_, and the _Threds_, they knit together, for the most
part, are so pellucid, and closely situate, that they frequently seem
to make One entire Body, as a piece of _Ice_ or a film of _Water_ it
self: or even as _Animal Skins_ sometimes shew, which yet are known to
be _Fibrous_.

11. §. The Situation of these _Threds_, is contrary to that of the
_Vessels_, as those by the Length, so these, chiefly, by the Bredth of
the _Root_, or horizontally, from one edge of the _Pith_ to the other.
They are continued circularly; whereby, as oft as they keep within the
compass of the several _Bladders_, the said _Bladders_ are Round: But
where they winde out of one _Bladder_, into another, they mutually
Intersect a _Chord_ of their several _Circles_; by which means, the
_Bladders_ become Angular.

12. §. The Contexture, likewise, both of the _Parenchymous Part_ of
the _Barque_, and of the Diametral _Portions_ inserted betwixt the
_Lignous_; is the same with this of the _Pith_, now described; that
is, _Fibrous_. Whence we understand, How the several _Braces_ and
_Threds_ of the _Vessels_ are made: For the _Vessels_ running by the
length of the _Root_, as the _Warp_; by the _Parenchymous Fibres_
running cross or horizontally, as the _Woof_: they are thus _knit_
and as it were _stitched_ up together. Yet their _weftage_ seemeth
not to be _simple_, as in Cloath; but that many of the _Parenchymous
Fibres_ are _wraped_ round about each _Vessel_; and, in the same
manner, are continued from one _Vessel_ to another; thereby knitting
them altogether, more closely, into one _Tubulary Thred_; and those
_Threds_, again, into one _Brace_: much after the manner of the _Needle
work_ called _Back-Stitch_ or that used in Quilting of Balls. Some
obscure sight hereof, may be taken in a _Thred_ of _Cambrick_, through
a _Microscope_. But it is most visible, in the _Leaves_ and _Flowers_
of some _Plants_. The Delineation of these Things I shall therefore
omit, till we come hereafter to speak of the other _Parts_.

13. §. From what hath been said, it may be conjectured; That the _Aer
Vessels_ successively appearing in the _Barque_, are formed, not out of
any _Fluid Matter_, as are the original ones: But of the _Parenchymous
Fibres_; _sc._ by changing them from a _Spherical_ to a _Tubulary
Forme_.

14. §. From the precedents, it is also manifest, That all the
_Parenchymous Parts_ of a _Root_, are _Fibrous_.

15. §. And lastly, That the whole Body of a _Root_, consisteth of
_Vessels_ and _Fibres_. And, That these _Fibres_ themselves, are
Tubulous, or so many more _Vessels_, is most probable: There only
wanteth a greater perfection of _Microscopes_ to determine.

16. §. The _Contents_ of the _Pith_ are, sometimes _Liquor_, and
sometimes a _Vaporous-Aer_. The _Liquor_ is always Diaphanous, as
that of the _Parenchymous Part_ of the _Barque_; and in nature, not
much differing from it. The _Aer_ is sometimes less, and sometimes
more _Vaporous_, than that of the _Barque_. By this _Aer_ I mean,
that which is contained in the _Bladders_. Within the Concaves of the
_Fibres_ which compose the _Bladders_, I suppose, there is another
different Sort of _Aer_. So that as in the _Bladders_ is contained a
more _Aqueous_; and in the _Vessels_, a more _Essential Liquor_: So
sometimes, in the same _Bladders_, is contained a more _Vaporous_; and
in the _Fibres_, a more Simple and _Essential Aer_.

TO _Philosophize_, is, To render the _Causes_ and _Ends_ of Things. No
man, therefore, that denieth _God_ can do this, Truly. ♦ _Theology_
the Beginning and End of _Philosophy_. ♦ For the taking away of the
_first Cause_, maketh all things _Contingent_. Now, of that which is
_Contingent_, although there may be an _Event_; yet there can be no
_Reason_ or _End_: so that Men should then study, That, which _is not_.
So the _Causes_ of Things, if they are _Contingent_, they cannot be
_Constant_. For that which is the _Cause_ of This, now; if it be so
_Contingently_, it may not be the _Cause_ hereafter: and no _Physical_
Proposition, grounded upon the _Constancy_ and Certainty of Things,
could have any foundation. He, therefore, that philosophiseth, and
denieth _God_, playeth a childish Game.

2. §. Wherefore _Nature_, and the _Causes_ and _Reasons_ of Things,
duly contemplated, naturally lead us unto _God_; and is one way
of securing our Veneration of Him: giving us, not only a general
Demonstration of his _Being_; but a particular one, of most of the
several _Qualifications_ thereof. For all _Goodness_, _Righteousness_,
_Proportion_, _Order_, _Truth_, or whatever else is Excellent and
Amiable in the _Creatures_; it is the Demonstration of the like in
_God_. For it is impossible, that _God_ should ever make any thing,
not like Himself, in some degree or other. These Things, and the very
Notions which we have of them, are _Conceptions_ issuing from the
_Womb_ of the _Divine Nature_.

3. §. By the same means, we have a greater assurance of the Excellency
of his _Sacred Word_. That He, who hath _Done_ all things so
transcendently well; must needs _Speak_ as well, as he hath _Done_.
That He, who in so admirable a manner, hath _made_ Man; cannot but
know best, What his true _Principles_ and _Faculties_ are; and what
_Actions_ are most agreeable thereunto: and, that having adorned
him with such _Beauteous_ and _Lovely_ ones; it is impossible, He
should ever put him upon the Exercise of those _Faculties_, in any
way _Deformed_ and _Unlovely_. That He should do all things, so well
_Himself_; and yet require his _Creatures_, to do otherwise, is
unconceivable.

4. §. And as we may come, hereby, to rectifie our Apprehension of His
_Laws_; so also, of His _Misteries_. For there are many Things, of
the _Manner_ of whose Existence, we have no certain Knowledge. Yet,
of their _Existence_, we are as sure, as our _Senses_ can make us.
But, we may as well deny, what _God_ hath Made, _To be_; as, what he
hath Spoken, _To be true_, because we understand not _how_. And the
knowledge of _Things_ being gradually attained, we have occasion to
reflect, That some _Things_, we can now well conceive, which we once
thought unintelligible. I know, therefore, what I _understand_ not;
but, I know not, what is _unintelligible_: what I know not now, I may
hereafter; or if not I, another; or if _no Man_, or other _Creature_,
it is sufficient, _That God fully understandeth Himself_. It is not,
therefore, the _Knowledge_ of _Nature_, but they are the _wanton
phansies_ of Mens minds, that dispose them, either to Forget _God_, or
to Think unduly of Him.

5. §. Nor have we reason to fear going _too far_, in the Study of
_Nature_; more, than the _entring_ into it: Because, the higher we
rise in the true Knowledg and due Contemplation of _This_; the nearer
we come to the _Divine Author_ hereof. Or to think, that there is any
Contradiction, when _Philosophy_ teaches that to be done by _Nature_;
which _Religion_, and the _Sacred Scriptures_, teach us to be done by
_God_: no more, than to say, That the _Ballance_ of a _Watch_ is moved
by the next _Wheel_; is to deny that _Wheel_, and the rest, to be moved
by the _Spring_; and that both the _Spring_, and all the other _Parts_,
are caused to move together by the _Maker_ of them. So _God_ may be
truly the _Cause_ of _This Effect_, although a Thousand other _Causes_
should be supposed to intervene: For all _Nature_ is as one Great
_Engine_, made by, and held in His Hand. And as it is the Watch-makers
_Art_, that the _Hand_ moves regularly, from hour to hour, although he
put not his Finger still to it: So is it the Demonstration of _Divine
Wisdome_, that the Parts of _Nature_ are so harmoniously contrived
and set together; as to conspire to all kind of Natural Motions and
Effects, without the Extraordinary and Immediate Influence of the
_Author_ of it.

6. §. Therefore, as the _Original Being_ of all Things, is the most
proper Demonstration of _Gods Power_: So the _successive Generations_,
and _Operations_ of Things are the most proper Demonstration of his
_Wisdom_. For if we should suppose,that _God_ did now make, or do
any Thing, by any Thing; then, no _Effect_ would be produced by a
_Natural Cause_: and consequently, He would still be upon the Work
of _Creation_: which yet _Sacred Scripture_ assureth us, He _resteth
from_. And we might exspect the Formation of a _Child_, in an _Egg_,
as well as in a _Womb_; or of a _Chicken_, out of a _Stone_, as an
_Egg_: And all Sorts of _Animals_, as well as _Plants_, might propagate
their _Species_, without Coition: and the like. For _Infinite Power_,
needeth not make any difference in the Things it undertakes to manage.
But in that, these Things are not only _made_, but _so made_, that
is, according to such certain Natural Laws, as to produce their
_Natural Effects_; here is the Sensible and Illustrious Evidence of
his _Wisdom_. Wherefore as the Wisdom of Government, is not seen, by
the King his interposing Himself in every Case; but in the contrivance
of the _Laws_, and Constitution of _Ministers_ in such sort, that it
shall be as effectually determin’d, as if he did so indeed: So the
more complicated and vastly Numerous, we allow the _Natural Causes_ of
Things to be; the more duely we conceive of that _Wisdom_, which thus
disposeth of them all, to their several _Effects_: All Things being
thus, as _Ministers_ in the Hands of _God_, conspiring together a
Thousand _Ways_, towards a Thousand _Effects_ and _Ends_, at one time;
and that with the same certainty, as if he did prepose to each, the
same Omnipotent _Fiat_, which he used at the Creation of the World.


7. §. THIS _Universal Monarchy_, as it is eminently Visible in
all other Particular _Oeconomies_; so is it, no less, in that of
_Vegetables_. Infinite Occurrences, and secret Intrigues, ’tis made
up of; of which we cannot skill, but by the help of manifold _Means_;
and those, in the foregoing _Idea_, have been lately proposed. ♦ The
Divine Wisdom seen in the Growth of _Plants_; if we observe,♦ Wherein,
although some _Experiments_ have been briefly touch’d: yet that which
I have hitherto chiefly prosecuted, hath been the _Anatomical_ Part;
and that not throughly neither. Notwithstanding, so far as Observations
already made will conduct us, I shall endeavour to go. And if, for the
better clearing of the way, I have intermixed some Conjectures; I think
they are not meerly such, but for which I have layd down some Grounds,
and of which, the _Series_ also of the following _Discourse_, may be
some further proof.


♦ _First_, How the _Ground_ is prepared. ♦ 8. §. LET US say then,
that the _Root_ of a _Plant_ being lodged in some Soil, for its more
convenient growth; ’tis necessary the Soil should be duly prepared for
it. The _Rain_, therefore, falling and soaking into the Soyl, somewhat
diluteth the Dissoluble _Principles_ therein contained; and renders
them more easily communicable to the _Root_: Being as a _Menstruum_,
which extracteth those _Principles_, from the other greater and useless
part of the Soil.

9. §. And the warm _Sun_, joyned with the diluting _Rain_, by both, as
it were a _Digestion_ of the Soil, or a gentile _Fermentation_ amongst
its several Parts, will follow: whereby the Dissoluble Parts therein,
will rot and mellow: that is, those _Principles_ which as yet remained
more _fixed_, will now be further _resolved and unlocked_, and more
copiously and equally spread themselves through the Body of the Soil.

10. §. These _Principles_, being with the growth of _Plants_
continually exhausted, and needing a repair; the successions,
therefore, of Wet, Wind, and other Weather, beat down and rot the
_Leaves_ and other _Parts_ of _Plants_. Whereby these (as _Weeds_ which
are wont to be buried under ground) become a _natural Manure_, and
Re-impregnate the Soil: Being thus, in part, out of their own Resolved
_Principles_, annually Compounded again.

11. §. Many of these _Principles_, upon their _Resolution_, being by
the _Sun_ more attenuated and volatilized; continually ascend into
the _Aer_, and are mixed therewith. Where, although they lose not
their _Vegetable Nature_, yet being amongst other purer _Principles_;
themselves also, depositing their Earthy feculencies, become more
subtile, simple and Essential Bodies.

12. §. And the _Aer_ being of an _Elastick_ or _Springy_ Nature,
pressing, more or less, upon all Bodies; it thereby forceth and
insinuateth it self into the Soil, through all its permeable Pores.
Upon its own entrance, it carries also many of the said _Vegetable_ and
_Essential Principles_ along with it; which, together with the rest,
are spread all over the Body of the Soil. By which means, though a less
Vehement, yet more Subtil _Fermentation_, and with the least advantage
of warmth, continuable, will be effected.

13. §. The _Principles_ being thus farther _resolved_ and subtilized,
would presently exhale away, if the _Rain_, again, did not prevent.
Which, therefore, falling upon and soaking through the Ground, is as
a fresh _Menstruum_, saturate or impregnate with many of them. And as
it still sinketh lower, it carries them along with it self, from the
Superficial, to the Deeper parts of the Ground: thus, not only maturing
those parts also, which, otherwise, would be more lean and cold; but
therein likewise, laying up and securing a _Store_, more gradually and
thriftily to be bestowed upon the Upper parts again, as they need.

14. §. And _Autumn_ having laid up the _Store_, _Winter_ following
thereupon, doth, as it were, lock the doors upon it. In which time,
some warmer Intervals, serve further and gradually to mature the
stored _Principles_, without hazard of their being Exhaled. And the
_Spring_ returning, sets the doors open again, with warmer and more
constant _Sun_, with gentle and frequent _Rain_, fully resolves the
said _Principles_; and so furnisheth a plentiful Diet, for all kinds
of _Vegetables_: being a _Composition_ of _Water_ chiefly, wherein are
resolved, some portions of _Earth_, _Salt_, _Acid_, _Oyl_, _Spirit_,
and _Aer_; or other Bodies of Affinity herewith.


♦ _Then_, How the _Sap_ is imbib’d, and distributed to the several
_Parts_. ♦ 15. §. THE ROOT standing in the _Ground_ thus prepared,and
being always surrounded with a _Barque_, which consisteth chiefly of
a _Parenchymous_ and _Spongy_ Body;[3] it will thus, as _Sponges_
do, naturally suck up the watry parts of the _Soil_ impregnate with
the said _Principles_. Which _Principles_ notwithstanding, being in
proportion with the watry parts, but few, and also more _Essential_;[4]
therefore in this _Parenchymous Part_, are they never much discovered,
either by _Colour_, _Taste_, or _Smell_. As it is probable, that
some distilled _Waters_, which discover nothing, to Sense, of the
_Plants_ from which they are distilled, may yet, in part, retain their
_Faculties_. And it is known, that many Bodies; as _Crocus Metallorum_,
convey many of their parts into the _Menstruum_, without any sensible
alteration thereof. So _Frost_ and _Snow_ have neither _Taste_ nor
_Smell_; yet from their _Figures_, ’tis evident, that there are divers
kinds of _Saline Principles_ incorporated with them; or at least, such
_Principles_ as are common to _them_ and divers kinds of _Salts_.

     [3] _P. 1. c. 3. §. 3._

     [4] _§. 11, 12._

16. §. The entrance of this Impregnate Water or _Sap_ is not without
difference, but by the Regulation of the intervening _Skin_; being
thereby _strained_ and rendred more pure: the _Skin_, according to the
thickness[5] or closeness thereof, becoming sometimes only as a _brown
paper_, sometimes as a _Cotton_, and sometimes as a _Bag_ of _Leather_
to the transient _Sap_, as the nature of it doth require. By which
it is also _moderated_, lest the _Barque_, being spongy, should suck
it up too fast, and so the _Root_ should be, as it were, surcharged
by a _Plethora_. And divers of the _Succiferous Vessels_ being mixed
herewith[6] and lying next the Soil, usually more or less _mortified_,
and so their _Principles_ somewhat _resolved_; the _Sap_ is hereby
better _specified_, and further _tinctured_; such parts of the _Sap_
best entring, as are most agreeable to those _Principles_; which the
_Sap_ also carries off, in some part, as it passeth into the _Barque_.

     [5] _P. 1. c. 2. §. 1._

     [6] _P. 1. c. 2. §. 4._

17. §. The _Sap_ thus _strained_, though it be _pure_, and consisteth
of _Essential_ parts; yet being _compounded_ of _heterogeneous_ ones;
and received into the _Parenchyma_ of the _Barque_ a laxe and spongy
Body, they will now easily and mildly _ferment_. Whereby they will be
yet further prepared, and so more easily insinuate themselves into
all the _Bladders_ of the said _Parenchyma_; swelling and dilating it
as far as the _Continuity_ of its parts will bear. Whereupon, partly
from the continued entrance of fresh _Sap_, and partly by a Motion or
Pressure of _Restitution_ in the swollen and Tensed _Bladders_ of the
_Parenchyma_, the _Sap_ is forced thence into the other parts of the
_Root_.

18. §. And because the _Parenchyma_ is in no place openly and Visibly
Pervious, but is every where composed of an Infinite Number of small
_Bladders_[7]; the _Sap_, therefore, is not only _fermented_ therein,
and fitted for Separation; but, as it passeth through it, is every part
of it, _strained_ an Hundred times over, from _Bladder_ to _Bladder_.

     [7] _P. 1. c. 3. §. 4._

19. §. The _Sap_ thus _fermented_, and _strained_, is distributed to
the other _Organical Parts_, according as the several _Principles_
of This, are agreeable to those whereof the said _Organical Parts_
consist. As the _Sap_ therefore passeth from _Bladder_ to _Bladder_,
such _Principles_ as are agreeable to those of the _Fibres_ of the said
_Bladders_, will adhere to, and insinuate themselves into the Body of
the _Fibres_; _sc._ _Watry_ chiefly, next _Acid_, then _spirituous_,
_Earthy_, _Aery_, and _Oleous_.[8]

     [8] _Idea, §. 50, 52._

20. §. And the _Sap_ by its continual appulse and _percolation_, as
it leaveth some parts upon the said _Fibres_; so as it is _squeezed_
betwixt them from _Bladder_ to _Bladder_, it licks and carries off
some others from them, in some _union_ together with it; and so is
_Impregnate_ herewith: as _Water_, by passing through a _Mineral Vein_,
becomes _tinctured_ with that _Mineral_.

21. §. The _Sap_ thus _Impregnate_ with some _united Principles_ of the
_Parenchymous Fibres_, passeth on to the _Lignous Vessels_, whereinto
their correspondent _Principles_ also enter; _sc._ _Watry_, _Saline_,
_Oleous and Earthy_ chiefly.[9] And because the _Parenchymous
Principles_ mixed with them, are in some degree _united_, and so more
ready to _fix_; some of these therefore will likewise enter into the
said _Vessels_. Whereupon, the _Alkali oleosum_ of the one, and the
_Acidum spirituosum_ of the other, meeting together; These, with the
other _Principles_, all _concentre_, and of divers _fluids_, become one
_fixed_ Body, and are gradually _agglutinated_ to the _Vessels_; that
is, The _Vessels_ are now _nourished_.

     [9] _Idea, §. 51, 52._

22. §. The supply of the _Sap_ still continued, the _Principles_
thereof will not only enter into the _Body_ of these _Parts_, but also
their _Concaves_. And the _Parenchymous Fibres_ being _wrapped_ about
the _Vessels_,[10] as often as the said _Fibres_ are more _turgid_ with
their own contained _Fluid_, they will thereby be somewhat _shortned_,
or contract in length; and so must needs _bind_ upon the _Vessels_, and
thereby, as it were, _squeeze_ some part of the _Fluid_, contained both
within themselves and the _Vessels_, back again into the _Bladders_.

     [10] _P. 1. c. 5. §. 12._

23. §. And the _Sap_ herein, being thus _tinctured_ with some of
the _united Principles_ of the _Vessels_, divers of them will now
also insinuate themselves into the _Parenchymous Fibres_, and be
incorporated with them: Whereby, the said _Fibres_, which before were
only _relaxed_ and _dilated_, are now also _nourished_, and not till
now. Some portion of the _united Principles_ both of the _Parenchymous_
and _Lignous Parts_, being necessary to the true _nutrition_ of Each:
As the Confusion and joynt assistance of both the _Arterious_ and
_Nervous Fluids_, is to the nourishment or coagulation of the _Parts_
in _Animals_.

24. §. Some portion of the _Sap_ thus doubly _tinctured_, is at the
same time transmitted to, and enters the _Body_ of the _Aer-Vessels_;
consisting chiefly of _Water_, _Aer_, and _Acid_; and, in like manner,
as in the other _Parts_ is herein _agglutinated_. And the appulse and
pressure of the _Sap_ still continued, some portion hereof is also
trajected into the _Concaves_ of the said _Vessels_; existing therein
as a most _Compounded Fluid_; partaking, more or less, both of the
_Principles_ and _Tinctures_ of the other _Organical Parts_, and of the
_Aer-Vessels_ themselves; being as it were, a _Mixed Resolution_ from
them all.

25. §. And the _Parenchymous Fibres_ being _wrapped_ about These, as
about the other _Vessels_,[11] and, in like manner, _binding_ upon
them; they thus frequently _squeeze_ part of the said contained _Fluid_
out again: As necessary, though not to the immediate Nourishment of
the _Parts_, yet the due Qualification of the _Sap_; being a Constant
_Aerial Ferment_, successively stored up within the _Aer-Vessels_, and
thence transfused to the _Sap_, in the other _Organical Parts_.

     [11] _P. 1. c. 5. §. 12._

26. §. And that there may be a better Transition of the _Sap_ thus
_tinctured_, to the several _Organical Parts_; therefore, none of them
are close set and compact within themselves, severally: For so, they
would be inaccessible to the _Sap_, and their inward Portions, wanting
a due supply of _Aliment_, would be starved. But the _Vessels_, both
of _Aer_ and _Sap_, being every where divided into _Braced_ Portions,
and other _Parenchymous_ Portions, filling up the spaces every where
betwixt them[12]; there is therefore a free and copious communication
of the _Sap_, (and so of all the _Tinctures_ successively transfused
into it) from _Part_ to _Part_, and to every Portion of every _Part_:
The _Parenchymous_ Portions, running betwixt the _Braces_, as the
smaller _Vessels_ do throughout the _Viscera_, in _Animals_. Whereby,
none of them want that Matter, which is necessary either for their
_Nutrition_, or for the good Estate of their _Contents_, or for the due
period of their Growth.

     [12] _P. 1. c. 3. §. 13. & c. 4. §. 4, 5, 7._

27. §. For the better _Tempering_ of the several parts of the _Sap_,
serve the _Diametral_ Portions of the _Parenchymous Body_ which run
sometimes directly through the _Barque_, as in _Lovage_, _Parsley_,
&c. is described and figur’d[13] Which being, all or most of them,
continued betwixt both the _Succiferous_ and the _Aer-Vessels_, from
the Circumference to the Centre; they hereby carry off a more Copious
and _Aerial Ferment_ from the One, and communicate it unto the Other.
For as the _Sap_ enters the _Barque_, the more _liquid_ part, still
passeth into the _succulent_ Portions thereof; the more _Aery_, is
separated into those White and Dryer _Diametral_ ones; and in its
passage betwixt the _Portions_ of the _Aer-Vessels_, is all along
communicated to them. Yet is it not a pure or _simple Aer_, but such
as carries a _Tincture_ with it, from the _Succiferous Vessels_. And
therefore it is observable, That when the _Diametral_ Portions are more
distant, the _Sap-Vessels_ run not in a Straight Line betwixt them, but
are Reciprocally so inclined, as to touch upon them; as in _Lovage_ is
visible: Thereby communicating their _Tincture_ to the _Aer_, as it
passeth by them, through the said _Diametral_ Portions.

     [13] _P. 1. c. 3. §. 7, 8._

28. §. By the continual appulse of fresh _Sap_, some, both of the
_aery_, and of all the other parts thereof are transmitted into
the _Pith_; where, finding more room, it will yet more kindly be
_digested_. Especially having the advantage herein of some degree of
Warmth; being herein remoter from the _Soil_, and, as it were, _Tunn’d_
up within the _Wood_, or the _Mass_ of surrounding _Vessels_. So that
the _Pith_ is a _Repository_ of better _Aliment_ gradually supplied
to those _Succiferous Vessels_, which are frequently scattered up and
down therein, and which ascend into the _Trunk_.[14] But where no
_succiferous Vessels_ are mixed, herewith, it usually becomes Dryer,
and is replenished with a more _Aerial_ and _Warmer Sap_; whereby the
growth of the _Caulis_ is promoted, as by an _Hot Bed_ set just under
it. And in many _Plants_ with divers knobbed _Roots_, the younger are
more succulent, serving chiefly to feed the _Stalk_: the Elder are
spongy and fill’d with _Aer_, for the fermenting of the _Sap_, and more
early growth of the _Stalk_: as in little _Celandine_, _Dogstones_ and
all of that Kindred. And thus all the _Parts_ have a fit _Aliment_
provided for their _Nourishment_.

     [14] _P. 1. c. 5. §. 3._


♦ How the several Parts are Nourish’d and Form’d. ♦ 29. §. IN THIS
_Nourishment_, the _Principles_ of the _Sap_ are, as is said,
_concentred_ and _locked_ up one within another:[15] Whence it is,
that the _Organical Parts_, being cleansed of their _Contents_, have
none of them any _Taste_ or _Smell_, as in the _Piths_ of _Plants_,
_Paper_ and _Linen Cloth_ is evident.[16] Because till by _Digestion_,
violent _Destillation_, or some other way, they are resolved, they
cannot act upon the _Organs_ of those Senses. For the same reason, they
are never _tinctured_, excepting by their _Contents_: and although,
to the bare Eye, they frequently shew _White_, yet viewed through a
_Microscope_, they all appear _transparent_. In like manner, as the
_Serum_ of _Blood_, _Whites_ of _Eggs_, _Tendons_, _Hairs_ and _Horns_
themselves are _transparent_, and without much _Smell_ or _Taste_,
their _Principles_ being, in all of them, more or less _concentred_:
But when ever these _Principles_, are forcibly _resolved_, they are
ever variously invested with all those _Qualities_.

     [15] _§. 21._

     [16] _Idea, §. 49, 51._

30. §. And as from the _Concentration_ of the _Principles_, in every
_Organical Part_, the said _Parts_ do thus far, all agree: So, from
the _Predominion_ of the _Principles_ of each _Part_, the rest are
controuled, not only to a _Concentration_, but an _Assimilation_ also;
whereby, the _Specifick Differences_, of the several _Organical Parts_,
are preserved. Hence the _succiferous Vessels_ are always _Tough_ and
very Pliable; for so are all _Barques_, wherein these _Vessels_ abound;
so is a Handful of _Flax_, which is nothing else but a heap of the
_succiferous Vessels_ in the _Barque_ of that _Plant_. For besides
_Water_, and _Earth_, an _Alkaline Salt_ and _Oyl_ are, as is said,
the predominant _Principles_ of these _Vessels_.[17] It is then the
_Oyl_, chiefly, by which these _Vessels_ are _Tough_: for being of a
tenacious Nature, by taking hold of other _Principles_, it marries
them together; and the _Alkaline Salt_ and _Earth_, _concentred_ with
it, addeth to it more _Strength_. Hence the _Caput Mortuum_ of most
Bodies, especially those that abound with _Oyl_ and a _Sal Alkali_, is
_brittle_ and _friable_; those _Principles_, which were the _Ligaments_
of the rest, being forced away from them. From the same Cause, the
_Parenchymous Parts_ of a _Root_, even in their Natural State, are
_brittle_ and _friable_; _sc._ Because their _Earthy_, and especially
_Oleous_ and _Saline Principles_ are, as is said,[18] so very few.
Therefore all _Piths_ and more _simple Parenchyma’s_, break _short_, so
_Corn_, and the _Roots_ of _Potato’s_, and divers other _Plants_, being
dryed, will easily be rub’d to _Meal_; and many _Apples_, after Frosts,
eat _mealy_; the _Parenchymous Parts_ of all which, are not only by
_Analogy_, but in Substance or Essence, the self same Body.[19]

     [17] _§. 21._

     [18] _§. 19._

     [19] _Lib. 1. c. 7. §. 14._

31. §. And as the _Consistence_ of the several _Organical Parts_, is
dependent on their _Principles_; so are their _Figures_. And first, the
_Succiferous Vessels_, from their _Alkaline Salt_,[20] grow in Length.
For by that Dimension, chiefly, This _Salt_ always _shoots_: And being
a less moveable _Principle_ than the rest, and so apt more speedily to
_fix_ or _shoot_: It thus overrules them to its own _Figure_. And even
as the Shape of a _Button_ dependeth on the _Mould_, the _Silk_ and
other Materials wrought upon it, being always conformable thereunto: so
here; the _Salt_ is, as it were, the _Mould_; about which, the other
more passive _Principles_ gathering themselves, they all consort and
fashion to it. Hence also the same _Sap-Vessels_ are not _pyramidal_,
as the _Veins_ of _Animals_; but of an equal bore, from end to end;
the _shootings_ of the said _Salt_, being also figured more agreeably
to that _Dimension_. And as by the _Saline Principle_, these _Vessels_
are _Long_; so by the _Oleous_,[21] they are every where _Round_,
or properly _Cylindrical_; without some joynt Efficacy of which
_Principle_, the said _Vessels_ would be _Flat_, or some way Edged and
_Angular_, as all _saline shoots_, of themselves, are; as those of
_Alum_, _Vitriol_, _Sal Ammoniac_, _Sea Salt_, _Nitre_, &c. And because
the _Spirituous_ and more _Fluid_ part of the _Principles_, is least
of all apt to _fix_; while therefore, the other parts fix round about,
This will remain moveable in the _Centre_; from whence every _Vessel_
is formed, not into a _solid_, but _hollow Cylinder_; that is, becomes
a _Tube_.

     [20] _P. 2. §. 21._

     [21] _Ib._

32. §. The _Lactiferous Vessels_ are _tubulary_, as the _Lymphæducts_,
but of a somewhat wider _Concave_ or _Bore_. For being their
_Principles_ are less _Earthy_ and _Oleous_, and also more loosely
_Concentred_; as from their easie corruption or _Resolution_ by the
_Aer_, it appears they are: they are therefore more tender, and so
more easily dilative, and yielding to the said _Spirituous_ part in
the Centre. And by this means, obtaining a wider _Bore_, they are more
adapted to the free motion of the _Milky Content_: which being an
Oleous and Thicker _Liquor_, than that in the _Lympheducts_; and having
no advantage of _pulsation_, as the _Blood_ hath in _Animals_; might
sometimes be apt to stagnate, if the _Vessels_, through which it moves,
were not somewhat wider.

33. §. As the _Saline Principle_ is the _Mould_ of the _Succiferous_,
so is the _Aerial_ of the _Aer-Vessels_.[22] Now the Particles of
_Aer_ strictly so called, at least of that part of it concerned in
the Generation of the _Aer-Vessels_, I suppose, are crooked: and that
by composition of many of those crooked ones together, some of them
become Spiral, or of some other winding _Figure_: and that thereupon
dependeth the _Elastick_ Property of the _Aer_, or its being capable
of _Rarefaction_ and _Condensation_ by force. Wherefore, the said
_crooked_ Particles of the _Aer_, first _shooting_ and _setting_
together, as the _Mould_, the other _Principle_ cling and _fix_
conformably round about them. So that, as by force of the _Saline
Principles_, the rest of them are made to _shoot_ out in _Long
continued Fibres_; so by force of the _Aerial_, those _Fibers_ are
still disposed into _Spiral Lines_, thus making up the _Aer-Vessels_.
And according as there are fewer of these _Aerial_ Particles, in
proportion to the _Saline_, the _Concave_ of the _Aer-Vessels_ is
variously wider, or the _Fibres_ continue their _shooting_ by wider
_Rings_; as those that come nearer to a _right Line_, and so are
more compliant to the _Figure_ and shooting of the _Saline_ parts.
And whereas the _Lympheducts_, shooting out only in length, are
never sensibly _amplified_ beyond their original size: These, on the
contrary, always, more or less, enlarge their _Diameter_; because their
_Fibres_, being disposed into _Spiral Lines_, must needs therefore,
as they continue their growth, be still dilated into greater and
greater _Rings_. And being at the bottom of the _Root_ more remote from
the _Aer_, and so having somewhat fewer Particles purely _Aerial_,
there ingredient to them, then at the top; they fall more under the
government of the _Saline_, and so come nearer to a _right Line_, that
is into greater _Circles_; and so the _Aer-Vessels_, made up of those
_Circles_, are there generally wider.[23]

     [22] _P. 1. c. 4. §. 23._ & _P. 2. §. 24._

     [23] _P. 1. c. 4. §. 16._

34. §. By mediation of their _Principles_, the _Parenchymous Parts_
likewise of a _Root_ have their proper _Contexture_. For from their
_Acid Salt_ they are _Fibrous_; from their _Oyl_, the _Fibres_ are
_Round_, and in all parts even within themselves; and from their
_Spirit_, it is most probable, that they are also _hollow_. But
because the _Spirit_ is, here, more copious than the _Aer_; and the
_Saline Principle_ an _Acid_,[24] and so, more under the government
of the _Spirit_, than is an _Alkali_; therefore are not the said
_Fibres_ continued in _straight Lines_, as the _Sap-Vessels_; or by one
_uniform_ motion, into _spiral_ lines, as the _Fibres_ in the _Aerial_;
but _winding_, in a circular manner, to and fro a _thousand ways_,
agreeable to the like _motions_ of the _Spirit_, that most _active_,
and here most _predominant Principle_. And the _Spirituous Parts_
being, as is said, here more copious and redundant, they will not only
suffice to fill up the Concaves of the _Fibres_, but will also gather
together into innumerable little spaces, without them: whence the
_Fibres_ cannot wind close together, as Thred, in a _Bottom_ of Yarn;
but are forced to keep at some distance, one parcel from another, and
so are disposed, as Bread is in baking, into _Bladders_.[25]

     [24] _§. 19._

     [25] _P. 1. c. 3. §. 4._

35. §. And the _under Fibres_ being _set_ first, as the _Warp_, the
_spirituous_ parts next adjacent, will incline also to _fix_, and
so govern an _over work_ of _Fibres_, wrapping, as the _Woof_, in
still smaller Circles round the other: whereby they are all knit
together.[26] For the same reason, the _Lympheducts_, being first
formed, the _Parenchymous Fibres set_ and _wrap_ about These
also.[27] And the _Aer-Vessels_ being formed in the Center, the
_succiferous_ run along those likewise (as _volatile Salts shoot_ along
the sides of a Glass, or _Frost_ upon a Window) and so are, as it were,
Incrustate about them in a _Ring_.

     [27] _P. 1. c. 5. §. 12._


♦ How the several _Parts_ come to be Situate or Dispos’d. ♦ 36. §. SOME
OF THE more Ætherial and Subtile parts of the _Aer_, as they stream
through the _Root_, it should seem, by a certain _Magnitisme_, do
gradually dispose the _Aer-Vessels_, where there are any store of them,
into _Rays_. This Attraction (as I take leave to call it) or _Magnetick
power_ betwixt the _Aer_ and these _Vessels_, may be argued, From the
nature of the _Principles_ common to them both: From the _Electral_
nature of divers other Bodies; the _Load-stone_ being not the only
one which is attractive: And from other Effects, both before[28] and
hereafter mentioned. Wherefore in the inferiour parts of the _Root_,
they are less Regular;[29] because more remote from the _Aer_. And in
the upper parts of many _Roots_, as _Cumfery_, _Borage_, _Parsnep_,
where those that are next the Centre are confused, or differently
disposed; ♦ _Tab. 7, 8, 9._ ♦ those next the _Barque_, and so nearer
the _Aer_, are postured more Regularly, and usually into _Rays_. For
the same reason it may be; that even the _Sap-Vessels_ in the _Barque_,
as often as the _Aer Vessels_ are more numerous, are usually disposed
into _Rays_, as following the direction of the _Aer-Vessels_. And
that the _Parenchyma_ of the _Barque_, is disposed into _Diametral
Portions_: and that where the _Aer Vessels_ are fewer or smaller, these
_Portions_ are likewise smaller or none; ♦ _Tab. 7, 8, 9._, &c. ♦
as in _Chervil_, _Asparagus_, _Dandelion_, _Orpine_, _Bistort_,
_Horse-Radish_, _Potato’s_, &c.

     [28] _Lib. 1. c. 2. §. 25. & c. 4. Append. §. 2, 3._

     [29] _P. 1. c. 4. §. 10._

37. §. The said Ætherial parts of the _Aer_, have a Power over the
_Aer-Vessels_ not only thus to Dispose them; but also to Sollicite and
_spread_ them abroad from the Center towards the Circumference of the
_Root_. By which means, those _Roots_ which have no _Pith_ in their
lower parts, obtain one in their upper.[30] And the same _Pith_, which
in the lower part, is ratably, small, in the upper, is more or less
enlarged.[31]

     [30] _P. 1. c. 5. §. 1._

     [31] _Ib. §. 4._

38. §. The _Spreading_ of these _Vessels_ is varied, not only according
to the _Force_ the _Aer_ hath upon them, but also their own greater
or less _Aptitude_ to yield thereto. As often therefore, as they are
Slenderer, they will also be more Pliable and recessive from the
Centre, towards the Circumference. Hence, in such _Roots_ where they
are small, they stand more distant; ♦ _Tab. 2, & 6._ ♦ as in _Turnep_,
_Jerusalem Artichoke_, _Potato’s_, and others; and so their _Braces_
are fewer: and in the same _Root_, where they are smaller, their
distance is greater. Besides, in these smaller _Aer-Vessels_, the
_Rings_ being less, and the _Spiral Fibres_ whereof they are made,
continuing to _shoot_; the said _Rings_ therefore, must needs be so
many more, as they are smaller; and so take up more space by the length
of the _Root_; and so, not being capable of being crowded in a _right
line_, every _Vessel_ will be forced to recede to a _crooked_ or
_bowed_ one.

39. §. The _Sap Vessels_, being by the _Parenchymous Fibres_ knit to
_these_, will likewise comply with Their motion, and spread abroad
with them. Yet being still smaller[32] and more pliable than the
_Aer-Vessels_, and so more yielding to the intercurrent _Fibres_ of
the _Parenchyma_, their _braced Threds_ will, sometimes, be much
more divaricated, than those of the _Aer-Vessels_; ♦ _Tab. 6._ ♦ as
in _Jerusalem Artichoke_. And because the _Succiferous Vessels_,
although they are joyned to the _Aerial_ by the _Parenchymous
Fibres_,[33] yet are not continuous with them; neither fall under
the like _Attractive Power_ of the _Aer_, as the _Aerial_ do; the
_Aerial_ therefore, upon their spreading, do not always carry all the
_Succiferous_ along with them; but often, if not always, leave many of
them behind them sprinkled up and down the _Pith_; ♦ _Tab. 6._ ♦ as in
_Parsley_, _Carrot_, _Jerusalem Artichoke_, _Turnep_, &c. may be seen.

     [32] _P. 1. c. 3. §. 16._

     [33] _P. 1. c. 5. §. 12._

40. §. The _spreading_ of the _Aer-Vessels_ still continued, several of
them, at length, break forth beyond the circumference of the _Root_;
and so are distributed, either in the lower parts, into _Branches_
and _Strings_; or at the top, into _Leaves_. And lest they should all
spread themselves into _Leaves_, and none be left for the _Caulis_;
as where they are very small, or the _Sap-Vessels_ to bound them, are
but few, they might; therefore divers of them are, oftentimes, more
frequently _braced_ in the Centre; ♦ _Tab. 6._ ♦ for which reason, they
cannot so easily separate and spread themselves from thence, but run
more inwardly up into the _Caulis_, as in _Borage_.


♦ How the whole _Root_ is differently sized and shaped. ♦ 41. §.
FROM THE various _Sizes_, _Proportions_, and _Dispositions_ of the
Parts, _Roots_ are variously _sized_, _shaped_, _moved_ and _aged_.
Those which, by their Annual Growth, are large; have fewer, both
_Aerial_, and _Sap-Vessels_, and a more copious _Parenchyma_. So that
the _Aer-Vessels_, or rather, the _Aery Ferment_ contained in them,
_volatilizing_ only a smaller portion of the _Sap_; the said _Sap_
is less capable of advancement into the _Trunk_; and so must needs
remain and _fix_ more copiously in the _Root_, which is thereby more
augmented. And where the _Sap-Vessels_ alone, are but few, the _Root_
is yet, ratably, somewhat large: but where they are numerous, it is
never so, as to its Annual Growth, in any proportion to their Number:
Because their _Tincture_, which is _Alkaline_, will go farther in
_setting_ the _Parenchymous Parts_: than the _Tincture_ of _These_,
which is _Acidulate_, will go, in _setting Them_.[34]

     [34] _P. 2. §. 31._

42. §. When the _Aer-Vessels_ are more pliable and sequent to
the Attraction of the _Aer_, and so _spread_ themselves, and the
_Succiferous_ together with them, more abroad; in the manner as hath
been said; the _Root_ also will grow more in _Breadth_; ♦ _Tab. 2, &
7._ ♦ the nutrition of the _Parenchymous Parts_, to which the _Vessels_
are adjacent, being thus, by the same dimension, more augmented; as in
_Turnep_, _Jerusalem Artichoke_, &c. ♦ _Tab. 7, & 8._ ♦ But where these
are not spread abroad, the _Root_ is but slender; as in _Asparagus_,
_Dandelion_, &c.

43. §. If the _Aer-Vessels_ be contracted into, or near the Centre,
and are somewhat Large or Numerous; and the _Succiferous_, also more
copiously mixed with, or surrounding them; the _Root_ grows very
Long; as do those of _Fenil_, _Vine_, _Liquirish_, &c. ♦ _Tab. 2, &
17._ ♦ For the _Aer-Vessels_ containing a more copious _Ferment_, it
will well digest and mature the _Sap_: Yet the _Succiferous_ being
over proportioned to them; the _Sap_ will not therefore, be so far
volatilized, as to ascend chiefly into the _Trunk_; but only to
subserve a fuller Growth of their _Vessels_: which being more numerous,
and so more sturdy, and less sequent to the expansive motion of the
_Aerial_; this their own Growth, and consequently, that of all the
other _Parts_, cannot be so much in Breadth, as Length.

44. §. Where the same _Aerial Vessels_ are Fewer, or more Contracted,
or sheathed in a Thicker and Closer _Barque_; ♦ _Tab. 7, 8._ ♦ the
_Root_ is smooth, and less _Ramified_, as in _Asparagus_, _Peony_,
_Dandelion_. But where more Numerous, sheathed in a Thinner _Barque_,
Smaller, or more Dilated; the _Root_ is more _Ramified_, or more
_Stringy_, ♦ _Tab. 2, & 7._ ♦ as in _Columbine_, _Clary_, _Beet_,
_Nicotian_. For being, as is said, by these means, more sequent to the
Attraction of the _Aer_; approaching still nearer the circumference of
the _Barque_, they at last strike through it, into the _Earth_. And the
_Parenchymous Fibres_ being wrapped about them, and the _Succiferous
Vessels_ knit to them by those _Fibres_;[35] therefore they never break
forth naked, but always invested with some quantity of these _Parts_ as
their _Barque_: where by, whatever _Constitutive Part_ is in the _main
Body_ of the _Root_, the same is also in every _Branch_ or _String_.

     [35] _P. 1. c. 5. §. 12._

45. §. From the same Expansion and Pliability of the _Aer-Vessels_,
the _Root_ oftentimes putteth forth _Root-Buds_; which gradually shoot
up and become so many _Trunks_. In the Formation of which _Buds_, they
are pliable and recessive all kinds of ways; being not only invited
Outward, toward the Circumference of the _Root_, as in _Root-strings_,
but also spread more Abroad every way, so as to make a _Root-Bud_:
Where as in the said _Root-strings_, they are always more Contracted.
♦ _Tab. 6._ ♦ Which, in respect of the Disposition of the _Parts_, is
the principal difference betwixt the _Root_ and the _Trunk_, as hath
been said.[36] Hence, those _Roots_, chiefly, have _Root-Buds_, ♦ _Tab.
11._ ♦ which have the smallest _Aer-Vessels_;[37] these, as is said,
being the most pliable and Expansive.

     [36] _P. 1. c. 1. §. 2, 3._

     [37] _P. 1. c. 4. §. 15._

46. §. But because the expansiveness of the _Vessels_, dependeth
also, in part, upon the Fewness of their _Braces_; therefore the said
_Buds_ shoot forth differently, in divers _Roots_. Where the _Braces_
are fewer, the _Buds_ shoot forth beyond the Circumference of the
_Root_, as in _Jerusalem Artichoke_; ♦ _Tab. 6._ ♦ where more close,
as in _Potato’s_, the _Buds_ lie a little absconded beneath it; the
_Aer-Vessels_ being here, by their _Braces_, somewhat checked and
curbed in, while the _Barque_ continueth to swell into a fuller Growth.

47. §. If the _Aer-Vessels_ are all along more equally sized, the
_Root_ is so also, or _Cylindrical_; as are those of _Eryngo_,
_Horse-Radish_, _Marshmallow_, _Liquirish_, &c. But if unequal,
growing still _wider_ towards the _bottom_ of the _Root_; then
the _Root_ is unequal also: But groweth, as is observable, quite
contrarily to the _Aer-Vessels_; not Greater, as They do; but still
smaller, or _pyramidally_; as in _Fenil_, _Borage_, _Nettle_,
_Patience_, _Thorn-Apple_, &c. is apparent. For the _Aer-Vessels_ being
considerably wider about the _bottome_ of these _Roots_; they there
contein a more Copious _Ferment_: Whereby the _Sap_ is there also more
volatilized, and plentifully advanced to the Upper Parts. Withal, thus
receiving into themselves, and so transmitting to the upper Parts, a
more plentiful _Vapour_, they hereby rob the _Parenchymous Parts_ of
their Aliment, and so stint them in their Growth.


♦ How _Roots_ are differently Mov’d. ♦ 48. §. FROM THE different
_Proportions_ and _Situation_ of the _Parts_, the _Motions_ of _Roots_
are also various. For where the _Aer-Vessels_ are spread abroad and
invested with a thinner _Barque_; ♦ _Tab. 8._ ♦ the _Root_ runs or
lies _Level_, as in the _level-Roots_ of _Primrose_, _Bishops-weed_,
_Anemone_, &c. may be seen. So that these _Roots_, as by the
_Perpendicular Strings_, which shoot from them into the _Earth_, and
wherein the _Aer-Vessels_ are contracted into their Center, they
are Plucked down[38]: So by the _Aer-Vessels_, which stand nearer
the _Aer_, and more under its Attractive Power[39] they are invited
_upwards_; whereby they have neither _ascent_ nor _descent_, but keep
_level_, betwixt both.

     [38] _P. 1. c. 1. §. 15._

     [39] _P. 2. §. 36._

49. §. But if these _Vessels_ are Contracted, standing either in,
or near the Centre, and are invested with a _Barque_ proportionably
Thick; the _Root_ striketh down _perpendicularly_, as doth that of
_Dandelion_, _Bugloss_, _Parsnep_, &c. ♦ _Tab. 7, 8._ ♦ And therefore
the said _Vessels_, although they are spread abroad in the _level
Roots_, yet in the _perpendicular_ ones of the same _Plant_, they are
always contracted; as by comparing the _Level_ and _Down-right Roots_
of _Ammi_, _Primrose_, _Jerusalem Artichoke_, _Cowslip_, and others, is
manifest.

50. §. If the _Aer-Vessels_ are Contracted, and Environed with a
greater number of _Succiferous_, the _Root_ grows _deep_; that is,
_perpendicular_ and _long_.[40] _Perpendicular_, from the Contraction
of the _Aer-Vessels_;[41] and _long_, from the Predominion of the
_Succiferous_, which in their growth, are extended only by that
Dimension, as in _Liquirish_, _Eryngo_, &c.

     [40] _P. 1. c. 1. §. 9._

     [41] _P. 2. §. 49._

51. §. If the _Succiferous_ are over proportioned to the _Parenchymous
Parts_, but under to the _Aer-Vessels_; the _Root_ is _perpendicular_
still, but groweth _shallow_: The _Succiferous_ being sturdy enough to
keep it _perpendicular_; ♦ _Tab. 7._ ♦ But the _Aer-Vessels_ having
a predominion to keep it from growing _deep_; as in _Stramonium_,
_Nicotian_, _Beet_, &c.

52. §. If, on the contrary, the _Parenchymous Parts_ are predominant
to the _Aer Vessels_; and that, both in the _Root_ and _Trunk_; then
the whole _Root_ changeth place, or _descends_.[42] For the said
_Aer-Vessels_, having neither in the _Trunck_, nor in the _Root_, a
sufficient Power to Draw it _upwards_; it therefore gradually yields
to the Motion of its _String-Roots_; which, as they strike into the
Soil, Pluck it down after them. And because the old _Strings_ annually
rot off, and new ones successively shoot down into the _Ground_, it
therefore annually still descendeth lower; as in _Tulip_, _Lily_, &c.
may be observed.

     [42] _P. 1. c. 1. §. 10. Lib. 1. c. 2. §. 25,_ and _4. Append.
          §. 10. P. 2. §. 36._

53. §. Where the _Aer-Vessels_ are much _spread_ abroad, and also
_numerous_, the _Root_ oftentimes, as to its several parts, _descends_
and _ascends_ both at once. So _Radishes_ and _Turneps_, at the same
time, in which their nether parts _descend_; their upper, (where the
said _Vessels_ are more loosely _braced_, and _spread_ more abroad than
in the lower parts) ♦ _Tab. 2._ ♦ do _ascend_, or make their Growth
_upward_. Hence also, the upper part of most young _Roots_ from _Seed_,
ascends: Because the first _Leaves_, being proportionably large, and
standing in a free _Aer_, the _Aer-Vessels_ therein, have a dominion
over the young _Root_; and so themselves yielding to the solicitation
of the _Aer_, _upwards_; they draw the _Root_, in part, after them.


♦ How _Roots_ are differently Aged. ♦ 54. §. BY THE _Situation_ and
_Proportions_ of the _Parts_, the _Age_ of the _Root_ is also varied.
For if the _Sap-Vessels_ have the greatest Proportion, the _Root_,
is _Perennial_, and that to the farthest extent, as in _Trees_ and
_Shrubs_. Because these _Vessels_ containing a more copious _Oyl_;[43]
and their several _Principles_ being more closely _Concentred_,
they are less subject to a _Resolution_, that is, a Corruption or
Mortification by the _Aer_.

     [43] _P. 2. §. 21._

55. §. If the _Parenchymous Parts_ have much the greatest, the _Root_
seldom liveth beyond Two Years; but afterwards perisheth either in
whole, or in part; as do divers _bulbous_, _tuberous_, and other
_Roots_; whether they are more Porous and Succulent, or more Close
and Dry. If Porous, all the _Liquid Principles_ standing herein more
abundant, either by a stronger Fermentation, or otherwise, Resolve the
_fixed ones_ of the _Organical Parts_; whence the whole _Root_, rots;
as in _Potato’s_. So also _Parsneps_, and some other _Roots_, which,
in a hard and barren _Soil_, will live several years, in another more
rank, will quickly rot. If the _Parenchyma_ be Close, then the _Aer_,
chiefly, entring in and filling it up, thus mortifies the _Root_;
not by Rotting the _Parts_, but over Drying them; as in _Satyrion_,
_Rape-Crowfoot_, _Monkshood_, &c.[44]

     [44] _P. 1. c. 1. §. 13, 16,_ & _P. 2. §. 28._

56. §. But if the _Aer-Vessels_ have the _greatest Proportion_, and
especially if they are more _large_, and withall, are _spread_ more
abroad: the _Root_ is _Annual_, as in _Thorn-Apple_, _Nicotian_,
_Carduus Ben_, &c. ♦ _Tab. 9._ ♦ And of the same Kindred, if any,
those are _Annual_, which have the most _Aer-Vessels_. So _Endive_
and _Sonchus_, which have store of _Aer-Vessels_, are both _Annual_:
whereas _Cichory_, in which they are fewer, is a _Perennial Root_.
For hereby a more copious _Aer_ being Transfused into all the
other _Parts_;[45] they are thus, by degrees, hardened, and become
sticky; and so impervious to the _Sap_, which ought to have a free
and universal Transition from _Part_ to _Part_. As _Bones_, by
_Precipitations_ from the _Blood_, at length, cease to grow. Or the
same more abundant _Aer_, so far _volatilizeth_ the _Liquors_ in the
_Root_, that they are wholly advanced into the _Trunk_, and so the
_Root_ is starved. Whence also the _Aer-Vessels_ of the _Trunk_; where
they are numerous, and over proportioned to the _Bulk_ of the _Root_,
as in _Corn_; they so far promote the advance of the _Sap_, as to
exhaust the _Root_, sucking it into a Consumption and Death.

     [45] _P. 2. §. 25, 26._


♦ How the _Contents_ of the several _Parts_ are made. ♦ 57. §. FROM
THE _Principles_ of the _Parts_, their _Contents_ and the several
_Qualities_ hereof are also various;[46] the _Fluid_ of each _Organical
Part_, being made, chiefly, by _Filtration_ through the sides thereof;
such of the _Principles_ in the _Sap_, being admitted into, and
transmitted through them, as are aptest thereunto. In the like manner,
as when _Oyl_ and _Water_, being poured upon a Paper, the _Water_
passeth through, the _Oyl_ sticks: or as the _Chyle_ is strained
through the _Coats_ of the _Guts_, into the _Lacteal Vessels_: or as
_Water_ in _Purgations_, is strained through the _Glands_ of the same
_Guts_, from the _Mesenterical_.

     [46] _Idea, §. 54._

58. §. The _Principles_ therefore of the _Parenchymous Fibres_ being
_spirituous_, _acid_, and _aerial_, they will also admit the like into
them; excluding those chiefly which are _Alkaline_ and _Oleous_.[47]
And as by the _Conjugation_ of such _Principles_ in the _Fibres_, the
like are capable of _admittance_ into their Body: so the _Proportion_
and _Union_ of the same _Principles_, regulates the _transmission_
hereof into their _Concave_. Wherefore, the predominant _Principles_
of the _Fibres_ being chiefly _acid_, next _spirituous_, and _aery_,
the more _aery_ ones will be _transmitted_. For if more of _them_
should _fix_ they must do so by similitude and adhesion: But where
there are fewer similary parts to adhere to, fewer must adhere. The
_Fibres_ therefore contain so many parts of _Aer_, as to _admit_
many more into their Body; but not to _fix_ them; which therefore
must needs, upon admission, pass through into their _Concave_; where,
together with some other more _spirituous_ parts, they make an
_Ætherial Fluid_. And because some _aqueous_ or _vaporous_ parts will
also strain through with them; hence it is, that as more and more of
these enter, they by degrees still thrust out the _aery_ ones; which
quitting the more _succulent Fibres_ of the _Parenchyma_, are forced to
betake themselves to the _dryer_ ones, _scil._ all those, whereof the
_Diametral Portions_ do consist. For the same reason the _Aery_ parts
being gradually excluded the _succulent Fibres_ of the _Barque_; they
are forced to recede and transmigrate into those of the _Pith_. And the
_Fibres_ of the _Pith_ themselves being filled, and the _Aery_ parts
still forced into them; they at length also strain through the _Fibres_
into the _Bladders_: whence it comes to pass, that while the _Barque_
is _succulent_, the _Pith_ is often times filled with _Aer_.

     [47] _P. 2. §. 19._

59. §. The _Lymphæducts_ being more _earthy_, _Salinous_; _oleous_, and
♦ _P. 2. §. 21._ ♦ _aqueous_, will both _admit_ and copiously _fix_
the like _Principles_, as their proper Aliment. The _Water_ being
more _perfluent_ than the rest, will therefore strain, with a lighter
_Tincture_ of them, into their _Concave_. Especially the _Oleous_
parts of these being _rampant_, and less apt to _fix_ and _seize_ the
_aqueous_, upon their entrance, than the _saline_.

60. §. The _Lactiferous_, appearing to be made, chiefly, by the
Constipation of the _Parenchymous Parts_ all round about their Sides;
the _Liquor_ conteined in those _Parts_, although it may easily enough
be transfused into the Hollow of these _Vessels_; yet seems it not,
with equal facility, to be refunded thence: So that the _thinner_ and
more _aqueous_ Portion only, passing off; the remainder, is, as it
were, an _Oleous Elixyr_, or extract, in the form of a _Milk_.

61. §. The _Fluid Ferment_ contained in the _Aer-Vessels_, is also in
part, dependent on the _Principles_ of those _Vessels_, being in their
percolation _tinctured_ therewith. But because the percolation is not
made _through_ the _Body_ of the _Fibres_ whereof the _Vessels_ are
composed, but only _betwixt_ them; therefore the transient _Principles_
more promiscuosly, yet with an over porportion of dryer Particles, pass
into the _Concaves_ of these _Vessels_, and so are herein all immersed
in a Body of _Aer_.[48] The _Fibres_ themselves, in the mean time, as
those of the _Parenchyma_, admitting and containing a more _Aery_ and
_Ætherial Fluid_.

     [48] _P. 2. §. 24._

62. §. The _Contents_ are varied, not only by the _Nature_, but also
the _Proportion_ and _Situation_ of the _Parts_, whereby the said
_Contents_ are with different Facility and Quantity, communicated one
to another. Hence it is, partly, that a _Vine_, or that _Corn_, hath
so little _Oyl_: _sc._ Because their _Aer-Vessels_, in proportion
with the other _Parts_, are so _Great_ and _Numerous_: in _Corn_, the
_Stalk_ being also very hollow, and so becoming as it were, one Great
_Aer-Vessel_. For the _Oily_ parts of the _Sap_, are so exceedingly
_attenuated_[49] by the _Aery Ferment_ contained in these _Vessels_;
that they are, for the most part, so far _immersed_ in the _Spirit_,
or mixed therewith, as not, by being collected in any considerable
Body, to be distinguishable from it. And the affinity that is betwixt
_Spirits_ and _Oils_, especially _Essential_, is manifest: Both are
very inflammable; Both will burn all away; The _Oders_, which we call
the _Spirits_ of _Plants_, are lodged in their _essential Oyl_; Both,
being duly _Rectified_, will mix as easily together, as _Water_ and
_Wine_. So that, although _Oyl_, by the separation of its _earthy_ and
_Saline_ parts, which give it its sensibly _oleous_ Body, may not be so
far _attenuated_, as to _produce_ a _Spirit_; yet that it may so far
be attenuated, and so be mixed therewith, as _not to be discerned from
it_, as in the forementioned _Plants_, will be granted.

     [49] _P. 2. §. 25,_ & _56._

63. §. Hence it is, that the _Lactiferous_ standing more remote from
the _Aer-Vessels_, and the _Succiferous_ interposing;[50] the _Liquor_,
therefore, contained in them, is not so much under the government of
the _Aerial Ferment_, and is thence, partly, more _Oily_. For the same
reason, all _Roots_ which are _Milky_, so far as I have observed, have
an under-proportion of _Aer-Vessels_, these being either Fewer or
Smaller.

     [50] _Tab. 9. & 16._


♦ How the _Odours_ of _Plants_ are made. ♦ 64. §. FROM what hath been
said, we may receive some information, likewise, of the _Odours_,
_Colours_, and _Tastes_ of _Plants_. And for _Odours_, I suppose,
That the chief Matter of them, is the _Aerial Ferment_ contained
in the _Aer-Vessels_. Not but that the _other Parts_ do also yield
their smell; but that _these_ yield the _strongest_ and the _best_,
and _immediately_ perceptible in _fresh_, _undryed_ and _unbruised
Plants_. For the _Aer_ entring into, and passing through the _Root_,
and carrying a _Tincture_, from the several _Organical_ and _Contained_
Parts, along with it, and at last entring also the _Concaves_ of the
_Aer-Vessels_; it there exists the most _Compounded_ and _Volatile
Fluid_, of all others in the _Plant_, and so the fittest matter of
_Odour_: and such an _Odour_, as answers to that of all the _Odorous_
parts of the _Plant_.[51] Wherefore the _Organical Parts_, being well
clensed of their _Contents_, smell not at all; Because the _Principles_
hereof are, as hath been said, so far _fixed_ and _concentred_
together. Hence also the _Contained Parts_ themselves, or any other
Bodies, as their _Principles_ are any way more _fixed_, they are less
_Odorous_: So is _Rosin_, less than _Turpentine_, and _Pitch_, than
_Tar_; and many the self same Bodies, when they are _coagulated_, less
than when they are _melted_. So also _Musk_, which is not so liquid as
_Civet_, is not so strong; nor _Ambergreece_, as _Musk_: For although
it hath a more excellent smell, than _Musk_ hath, yet yieldeth it not
so easily; since it is a more _fixed_ Body, and requireth some _Art_
to be opened. Hence also the _Leaves_ of many _Plants_ lose their
_Odour_ upon _rubbing_: Because the _Aer-Vessels_ being thereby broken,
all their _contained odorous Fluid_ vanisheth at once: which before,
was only strained gradually through the _Skin_. Yet the _fixed_ Parts
themselves, upon drying, are so far altered by the _Sun_ and _Aer_, as
to become resoluble, and volatile, and thence odorous.

     [51] _P. 2. §. 24._


♦ How their _Colours_. ♦ 65. §. SO ALSO of their _Colours_. As
whence the _Colours_ of the _Skins_ are varied. For divers of the
_Sap-Vessels_, together with the _Parenchymous Parts_ successively
falling off from the _Barque_ into the _Skin_[52] by their proximity
to the _Earth_ and _Aer_, their _Sulphureous_ or _Oleous Principle_
is more or less _resolved_, and so produceth divers _Colours_. So
those _Roots_ which turn _purple_ any where within, have usually a
_blacker Skin_; the one of those two _Colours_ being, by a resolution
and corruption of parts, easily convertible into the other, as in
_Cumfry_, _Thistle_, &c. So the _Milk_ of _Scorzonera_, contained in
the _Vessels_ of the _Barque_, upon drying, turneth into a _brown
Colour_: Wherefore the _Skin_, in which there are divers of those
_Vessels_, is of the _same_. So both the _Milk_ and _Skin_ of _Lovage_
is of a brownish _yellow_. But _Parsnep_ hath a clearer _Sap_ in all
its _Vessels_, and a whiter _Skin_. So _Potato’s_, being cut traverse,
after some time out of ground, have divers _red_ specks up and down
where the _Vessels_ stand, and their _Skin_ is accordingly _red_.

     [52] _P. 1. c. 2. §. 2, 4._

66. §. The reason, I say of these _Colours_, is the _resolution_ or
_reseration_ of the _Principles_ of the several _Parts_, chiefly,
by the _Aer_, and a _lighter mixture_ of them consequent thereupon:
whereby the _Sulphureous_ or _Oyly Parts_, which were before
_concentred_, are now more or less _rampant_, discovering themselves
in divers _Colours_, according as they are diversly mixed with the
other _Principles_. Hence these _Colours_ are observable, according to
the nature of the _Parts wherein_ they _are_, or whereunto they are
_adjacent_: So where the _Lympheducts_ doe run, there is a _Red_, or
some other _Sulphureous Colour_; the _Oleous Principles_ being, as is
said,[53] more copious in these _Vessels_; as in the _Bark_ of _Peony_,
the inward parts of _Potato’s_, &c. may be seen. But the _Parenchymous
Parts_, where more remote from the said _Vessels_, they are usually
_White_, or but _Yellow_: the _Sulphureous Principle_ of these _Parts_,
being, as hath been said, but sparing.[54] The same is seen in those
_Roots_ which shew both _Red_ and _Yellow_: those _Parts_, principally,
where the _Succiferous Vessels_ run, being _Red_; but those _Parts_,
where only the _Aer-Vessels_ are mixed with the _Parenchymous_,
being _Yellow_; as in _Patience_. So likewise the _pithy_ part of a
_Carrot_, where the _Aer-Vessels_ have very few _Succiferous_ mixed
with them, is _Yellow_; but the _Barque_, where the _Succiferous_ are
very numerous, is _Red_. For the same reason, many _Roots_, which are
_Whiter_ in their upper parts, are _Purple_ or _Reddish_ in their
inferiour, as _Avens_, _Strawberry_, &c. Because those lower parts,
having lain longer[55] under ground (these being _descending Roots_)
their _Principles_ are, thereby, somewhat more _resolved_, and so the
_Oleous_, _ramp_ and spread all over the rest in that _Colour_.

     [53] _P. 2. §. 21._

     [54] _P. 2. §. 20._

     [55] _P. 2. §. 13._

67. §. And that the _Resolution_ of the _Sulphureous_ and other
_Principles_ is partly effected by the _Aer_, appears, In that,
where the _Aer_ hath a free access to the _Succiferous Vessels_, the
_Colours_ are there, chiefly produced, or are more conspicuous. So in
_Potato’s_, where the _Succiferous Vessels_ are either next to the
external _Aer_, as in the _Skin_; or contiguous with the _Aer-Vessels_,
as in the _Ring_ within the _Barque_; there, they produce a _Red_:
but where more remote from both, as in the middle of the _Barque_,
and Centre of the _Root_, there they produce none. Hence also it is,
that the _Leaves_ and _Flowers_ of some _Plants_, as _Bloodwort_,
_Wood-Sorrel_, _Radish_, _Jacea_, &c. although _Green_ or _White_
in the greatest portion of their _Parenchymous Part_; yet where the
_Succiferous_ and _Aer-Vessels_ run together, they are of _Red_,
_Blue_, and other _Colours_; the _Oleous parts_ of the _one_, being
_unlocked_ and _opened_, by the _aery_ of the _other_.


♦ How their _Tastes_. ♦ 68. §. AND LASTLY, of their _Tasts_.
Most _Roots_ which are _acres_ or _bitting_, have a very copious
_Parenchyma_ in proportion with the _Succiferous Vessels_, as
of _Arum_, _Dragon_, and others: Because the _Saline_ and other
_Principles_ are not so much _hot_, by any sufficient quantity of
_Sulphureous_, from those _Vessels_, in which the _Sulphur_, as is
said, is more abundant;[56] but rendred rather _pungent_, from some
_Spirit_ and _Aer_. But divers _Umbelliferous Roots_, especially which
abound with _Lactiferous Vessels_, are _hot_; as _Fenil_, _Lovage_,
_Angelica_, &c. Yet is it not their _Oyl_ alone that makes them _hot_,
but the combination thereof with the _Saline_ Parts: as is manifest,
from the nature of the _Seed_ of these _Plants_; wherein, as the _Oyl_
is most copious; So being held to a Candle till they burn, constantly
_spit_; which cometh to pass, by the eruption of the _Saline_ Parts:
and is the very same effect, with that which followeth upon burning
of _Serum_ or _Blood_. And therefore, as these _Seeds_ are more
_hot_, they also _spit_ the more; So those of _Cumine_, which, though
fulsom, yet are not so _hot_, _spit_ less; _Fenil_ and _Dill_, which
are _hotter_, more; there being a greater quantity of _volatile Salt_
contained herein. Hence all _Essential Oyls_ are _hot_, the _Spirit_
and _volatile Salt_, being incorporated herewith. And some of them
will _shoot_, and crystallize as _Salts_ do, as that of _Anise_; which
argues a mixture of a considerable quantity of _volatile Salt_. As also
doth the Nature of these _Oyls_, in being amicable to the _Stomach_,
_Carminative_, and sometimes _Anodyne_; _scil._ as they kill some
_fetid_, or _corrosive Acid_: for _volatile Salts_ themselves will have
the like operation in some cases as these _Oyls_.

     [56] _P. 2. §. 21._

69. §. Many _Lactiferous Roots_, as _Taraxacum_ and others of that
kind, are not so much _hot_, as _bitter_. For although by the
_Lactiferous Vessels_ they are very _Oyly_; yet those _Vessels_ being
posited in _Rings_, and not in _Rays_, and having no _Diametral
Portions_ running through their _Barque_ to the _Aer-Vessels_; ♦ _Tab.
13._ ♦ the _Acido-Aerial Parts_ do hereby, although not _mortifie_,
yet so far _refract_ the _saline_, lightly _binding up_ the _Oleous_
therewith, as to produce a _bitter Taste_. So, many _sweet_ Bodies,
upon burning, become _bitter_; the _Acid_ Parts, now becoming
_rampant_, and more copiously mixed with the _Oleous_.

70. §. The _Roots_, or other Parts, of many _Umbelliferous Plants_,
have a _sweetish Taste_, as both the _Sweet_, and _Common Chervil_;
both the _Garden_, and _wild Carrot_; _Parsnep_, _Fenil_, &c. the
_Saline Principles_ being _concentred_ in the _Oyly_, and both of
a moderate quantity with respect to the rest. For by the _Oyly_,
the _Saline_ is rendred more _smooth_ and amicable; and both being
moderate, they are not therefore _hot_, as in some other _Umbelliferous
Roots_; but by the predominion of the other _Principles_, made _mild_.
Hence it is, that _Sugar_ it self is _sweet_, _scil._ because it is an
_Oleous Salt_; as is manifest, from its being highly _inflammable_;
its easie _dissolution_ by a moderate _Fire_, without the addition
of _Water_; and in that, being melted with _Turpentine_, and other
_Oily_ Bodies, it will _mix_ together with them. So also the _Acid
Parts_ of _Vinegar_, being _concentred_ in the _Salino-sulphureous_ of
_Lead_, produce a _Sugar_. Hence _Barley_, which upon _Distillation_ or
_Decoction_ yeildeth only an _acid_; being turned into _Mault_, becomes
_sweet_. Because, being _steeped_, _couched_, and so _fermented_,
the _oleous_ parts are thereby _unlocked_, and becoming _rampant_,
over the other _Principles_, altogether produce that _Taste_. And the
_Bile_ it self, which, next to _Water_ and _Earth_, consisteth most of
_oily_ parts, and of many both _saline_ and _acid_ is a _bitter-sweet_.
Wherein, as some of the _Saline_ and _Acid_ parts, smoothed by the
_Oleous_, produce a _Sweet_: So, some of the _Oleous_, impregnated with
the _Saline_, and the _Acid_, doe hereby produce a _Bitter_.

      _The Descriptions of several_ Trunks, _as they appear to the
                               bare Eye._


_TO the_ end we may clearly understand, what the _Trunk_, _Stalk_, or
_Branch_ of a _Plant_, is; I shall by these _Figures_ here before us,
Describe the several _Parts_, whereof it is compounded.

1. §. And for examples sake, I shall in the first place, Describe the
_Trunks_ of some _Plants_, as being cut tranversly, and accurately
observ’d, they appear to the naked Eye. And some others, as by the
length. Which having done, I shall next proceed to a more particular
Description of divers other _Trunks_ and _Branches_ as they appear
through a good _Microscope_. In both shewing, not only what their
several _Parts_ are, as generally belonging to a _Branch_; but also,
by a Comparative Prospect, in what respects they are _specifically_
distinguished one from another, in the several _Sorts_ of _Branches_.


2. §. I SHALL begin where the Work of _Nature_ appears less
Diversify’d: as in the _Stalk_ of _Maze_ or _Indian Wheat_. In which,
although there are the same _Parenchymous_ and _Lignous Parts_, as in
all other _Plants_; ♦ _Tab. 18._ ♦ yet is there neither _Barque_, nor
_Pith_; the _Vessels_ being dispersed and mixed with the _Parenchyma_,
from the Circumference to the Centre of the _Stalk_: Saving, that in
and next the _Skin_, there seems to be no _Aer-Vessels_. Every where
else, they run up, like fine _Threds_, through the length of the
_Stalk_: Each _Thred_ being also surrounded with _Sap-Vessels_; which
in a Slice cut transversly, appear in very small and dark colour’d
_Rings_. The like structure may also be seen in the _Sugar-Cane_, and
some other _Plants_.


3. §. LET the next _Trunk_ be that of _Taraxacum_, or _Dandelion_. In a
_slice_ whereof, being cut transversly, is seen next the _Skin_, first,
a simple, white, and close _Parenchyma_ or _Barque_; ♦ _Tab. 18._ ♦
made up of _Vesicles_; but such as are exceeding small; and hardly
visible without a _Glass_.

4. §. Within This, stand _Milk-Vessels_ in seven or eight distinct
_Colums_, of different size: each _Colum_ being also made up of seven
or eight _Arched Lines_. Betwixt these _Colums_, run as many _Diametral
Portions_, derived from the _Barque_, into or towards the _Pith_.

5. §. Next within These, stand the _Aer-Vessels_. Which are likewise
divided, by the said _Diametral Portions_, into divers _Arched Lines_.
The _size_ of these _Vessels_, as well as their _number_, is small.

6. §. Within These, stands the _Pith_, consisting of very small
_Vesicles_ or _Bladders_, as the _Barque_. ’Tis very small, the
_Diameter_ hereof, being scarce one _fifth_, of that of the _Pith_ of
_Borage_. But the _Barque_ of _Borage_ is not half so thick as this of
_Dandelion_.


7. §. FOR a Third _Stalk_, we may take that of _Borage_; wherein there
is some further Variety. For in a _slice_ hereof, cut transversly,
there appears, first a Tough, yet Thin and Transparent _Skin_. Within
this _Skin_, and _Continuous_ therewith, there is also a Thin _Ring_
of _Sap-Vessels_: ♦ _Tab. 18._ ♦ which, without being crushed in the
least, do yield a _Lympha_.

8. §. Next standeth the _Parenchyma_ of the _Barque_. Which is made
up of a great number of very small _Vesicles_ or _Bladders_. Upon
the inner _Verge_ of this _Parenchyma_, standeth another _Ring_ of
_Sap-Vessels_: which also yield a _Lympha_; and that different, as is
probable, from the _Lympha_ in the utmost _Ring_. Hitherto goes the
_Barque_.

9. §. Adjacent to the _Ring_ of _Sap-Vessels_, on the inner _Verge_
of _Barque_, stand the _Aer-Vessels_ on the outer _Verge_ of the
_Pith_. Not in a _Ring_; but in several _Parcels_; some _Parcels_ or
_Conjugations_, in the figure of little _Specks_; others, in little
_Arched Lines_, almost like an V _Consonant_. And being viewed in
a good _Glass_, there appears to be within the compass of every
larger _Speck or Parcel_, about 20 or 30 _Aer-Vessels_ and within the
smallest, about 8 or 10.

10. §. The _Pith_, in a well grown _Stalk_ of this _Plant_; is always
_hollow_. But originally, it is _entire_. It is likewise wholly made
up of a great number of _Vesicles_: of which, through a _Glass_, some
appear _Pentangular_, others _Sexangular_, and _Septangular_. Most of
them are larger than those of the _Barque_; so as to be plainly visible
to a naked Eye.


11. §. A FOURTH _Trunk_, shall be that of _Colewort_, which seems
likewise, to have at least, two Sorts of _Lymphæducts_. For being cut
transversly, as the former, we may observe, next the _Skin_, a very
close _Parenchyma_, of a darkish Green. Wherewith are mixed some few
_Sap Vessels_, which give it that _Colour_.

12. §. Within This, stands a _scalloped Parenchymous Ring_, or a
_Ring_ of many short and slender white _Arches_. ♦ _Tab. 18._ ♦ Which
all round about the _Barque_, meeting together, run in so many white
_Diametral Portions_, or extream small _Rays_, into the _Pith_.

13. §. Betwixt these white _Rays_, and next of all to the said white
_Arches_, stand as many small _Parcels_ of _Sap-Vessels_, like so
many little _Half-Ovals_. Within each of which, is included a white
_Parenchyma_.

14. §. On the inner _Verge_ of the _Barque_, stands another Sort of
_Sap-Vessels_, in one slender and entire _Ring_. And so far goes the
_Barque_.

15. §. Next within this _Ring_ stand the _Aer-Vessels_, in several
_Parcels_, diametrically opposite to the said white _Parenchymous
Parcels_ next without the _Sap-Ring_.

16. §. Last of all, and more within the _Pith_, stand the same kind
of _Sap-Vessels_, as those of the _Half-Ovals_. Both these, by small
lines, run one into another; thus, on both sides, hemming in the
_Aer-Vessels_, and so making altogether, so many little _Pyramids_.


17. §. LET a _Fifth_ be that of _Holyoak_. In which, the Curiosity
of _Nature_, is still more copious: presenting us, as it seems, with
Three sorts of _Lymphæducts_; Of which, two yield a _Thin_; the Third,
a _Thick Lympha_. For being cut, as before, next to the _Skin_, stands
the _Barque_; somewhat close, and, in proportion, _Thick_.

18. §. Towards the inner _Verge_ hereof, stand one sort of
_Sap-Vessels_, postur’d in short _Rays_. These _Vessels_ yield a
_Mucilage_. And on the inner _Verge_ of the _Barque_, stands a Thin
_Ring_ of other _Sap-Vessels_, which yield a _thinner Liquor_. ♦ _Tab.
18._ ♦

19. §. Next within the _Barque_ stand the _Aer-Vessels_, postur’d
likewise in short _Rays_, diametrically opposite to those in the
_Barque_. In every _Ray_, there are about twelve or sixteen _Vessels_.

20. §. Lastly, and more within the _Pith_, there stand other
_Sap-Vessels_, all in very Thin or Slender _Arched-Lines_; thus hemming
in the several _Parcels_ of _Aer-Vessels_.


21. §. FOR a _Sixth_, I will take that of Wild _Cucumer_: Wherein
is also found a _Mucilaginous Lympha_. For first of all, next to
the _Skin_, there is a _Ring_ of _Sap-Vessels._ Which _Ring_ is
also radiated, the _Rays_, all poynting towards, and most of them
terminating on, the _Skin_. ♦ _Tab. 18._ ♦

22. §. Next of all, there is a thick, and simple _Parenchymous Ring_.
On the inner _Verge_ whereof, there are other _Sap-Vessels_ standing in
_Parcels_, also in a _Ring_. So far goes the _Barque_.

23. §. Next within, stand the _Aer-Vessels_, in as many _Parcels_,
contiguous to those of the _Sap-Vessels_ aforesaid. To which likewise
are adjoyned as many more _Parcels_ of _Sap-Vessels_ within the _Pith_,
opposite to the said _Sap-Vessels_ within the _Barque_.


24. §. FOR a _Seventh_, we may choose that of _Scorzonera_. In which,
the _Vessels_ are both _Lymphæducts_, and _Lactiferous_. All of them,
with the _Aer-Vessels_, in a radiated posture. For first next the outer
Edg of the _Barque_, stand the _Lactiferous_, in little _Specks_. ♦
_Tab. 18._ ♦ Next to these, on the inner Edg of the _Barque_, stand the
_Lymphæducts_, in the same form.

25. §. Hereunto adjacent, on the outer Edg of the _Pith_, stand the
_Aer-Vessels_, some in _Specks_, and some in extream short _Lines_;
hardly distinguished, without a very nice Inspection.

26. §. Within These, are placed other _Lymphæducts_, opposite to those
in the _Barque_. And within these _Lymphæducts_, still in the same
radiated Line, run more of the _Milk-Vessels_.


27. §. AN EIGHTH, may be that of _Burdock_; Wherein first, there are
a Sort of _Lymphæducts_, which stand in _Arched Parcels_, round the
_Trunk_, adjacent to the _Skin_. ♦ _Tab. 18._ ♦

28. §. Within these, about the middle of the _Barque_, run the
_Milk-Vessels_, in the form of small round _Specks_.

29. §. Next to these on the inner Edg of the _Barque_ are placed other
_Lymphæducts_. Which, together with more of the same in the _Pith_, and
the _Aer-Vessels_ betwixt them, stand all in Radiated Lines, of several
Lengths, and all sharpning towards the Centre.


30. §. LET the _Ninth_, be that of _Endive_: In which there is also
much curious Work. ♦ _Tab. 18._ ♦ Next to the _Skin_, there is, first,
a thick and simple _Parenchyma_. Then there is a kind of _Undulated
Ring_ of _Milk-Vessels_. Within which stand a Sort of _Lymphæducts_,
in several _Parcels_; some, in _Arched Half-Ovals_; others, in short
slender _Rays_. Betwixt these _Parcels_, many of the _Milk-Vessels_
likewise stand.

31. §. Next there is an _undulated Ring_ of other _Lymphæducts_,
parting as in most _Trunks_, betwixt the _Barque_ and the _Pith_.
Within which, are the _Aer-Vessels_. And within These, more
_Sap-Vessels_. Both of them, in small _Specks_, answerable, or opposite
to the _Rays_ in the _Barque_.

♦ _Tab. 18._ ♦ 32. §. I SHALL give also one or two Examples of _Trees_,
or _Arborescent Plants_; the _Vine_ and _Common Sumach_. In a Slice
of the former cut transversly, next the _Skin_, there is a Thin
_Barque_. In the inner part whereof, adjacent to the _Wood_, stand
the _Lymphæducts_ in several _Half-Oval Parcels_, opposite to so many
Radiated Pieces of the _Wood_.

33. §. The _Wood_ is divided into the said Pieces, by as many
_Parenchymous Rays_, inserted from the _Barque_, and so continuous
therewith.

34. §. Within these Radiated Pieces of _Wood_, stand the _Aer-Vessels_;
the largest of which, especially if held up against the light, are
plainly visible to the bare Eye.

35. §. Within the hollow of the _Wood_, stands the _Pith_; in the young
Growths always large. In the utmost _Verge_ whereof, adjacent to the
_Wood_, stand a few more _Sap-Vessels_ of the same Sort with those in
the _Barque_.


♦ _Tab. 18._ ♦ 36. §. IN A like Slice of _Common Sumach_, contiguous
to the hairy _Skin_, there is a _Ring_ of _Lymphæducts_. Next to this
a Simple _Parenchyma_. Then several _Arched Parcels_ of _Lymphæducts_.
Within these, a _Ring_ of _Milk-Vessels_. And then a _Ring_ of other
_Lymphæducts_. Thus far the _Barque_.

37. §. Within the _Barque_, stands the _Wood_, divided into several
_Portions_, by the Diametral _Insertions_ divided from the _Barque_. In
the Body of the _Wood_, stand the _Aer-Vessels_, very much smaller than
in the _Vine_.

38. §. The hollow of the _Wood_ is filled up with the _Pith_. In the
Circumference of which, stands a _Ring_ of _Lymphæducts_, of the same
sort with those next to the _Wood_ without.

39. §. All the _Parts_ of these _Trunks_, may, as I have now described
them, be observed without a _Microscope_: excepting the _Bladders_
and number of _Aer-Vessels_. Yet Three things are hereunto necessary;
_viz._ a good _Eye_, a clear _Light_, and a _Rasor_, or very keen
_Knife_, wherewith to cut them with a smooth surface, and so as not to
Dislocate the _Parts_.


40. §. UPON _Inspection_ also by the length, there are some
particulars, common, more or less, to most _Plants_, yet better
observable in some, than in others. As first, the _Reticulation_ of
the _Vessels_, (formerly described) not only in the _Wood_, but in
the _Barque_: ♦ _Tab. 19._ ♦ which is evident in a young _Branch_ of
_Corin_, upon the very Surface thereof, when some of the _Vessels_
begin to be cast off into the _Skin_. And so, by stripping off the
_Skin_, upon the Surface of the _Wood_.

41. §. In cutting by the length, as well as transversly, the young
_Fibres_, which grow within the _Wood_ in the Edg of the _Pith_, are
also seen. As likewise the manner of the Derivation of the _Parts_ of
the _Bud_ from the _Branch_ or _Stalk_; as in _Sonchus_. There are also
many Varieties in the _Pith_, such as those hereafter mentioned[57]
which fall under observation only in cutting by the length.

     [57] _Chap. 4._




                                CHAP. II.

       _Of the_ Barque, _as it appears through a good Microscope._


I NOW proceed to a more particular _Description_ of several _Trunks_
and _Branches_, as they appear through good _Glasses_.

1. §. Now the _Trunk_, or _Branch_ of every _Tree_, hath Three General
_Parts_ to be described; _sc._ the _Barque_, the _Wood_, and the
_Pith_. That likewise of every _Herbaceous Plant_, hath either the same
Three _Parts_; or else Three _Parts_ Analogous; _sc._ the _Cortical_,
the _Lignous_, and the _Pithy Parts_.

2. §. The _Barque_ consisteth of two _Parts_, _sc._ the outmost or
_Skin_, and the _Main Body_. The _Skin_ is generally composed, in part,
of very small _Vesicles_ or _Bladders_, cluster’d together. That is,
originally it is so; but as the _Plant_ grows, the _Skin_ dries, and
the said _Bladders_, do very much shrink up and disappear.

3. §. Amongst these _Bladders_ of the _Skin_, there are usually
intermixed a sort of _Lignous Fibres_, or _Vessels_, ♦ _Tab. 20._ ♦
which run through the length of the _skin_; as in _Mallow_, _Nettle_,
_Borage_, _Thistle_, and most _Herbs_. Which is argued not only from
the Toughness of the _skin_ by means of the said _Vessels_; but in some
_Plants_, may be plainly seen, as in _Teasle_. In which, the several
_Fibres_, which run by the length of the _Stalk_, are also conjoyned by
other smaller ones, which stand transversly.

4. §. Whether they are _Aer-Vessels_, or _Sap-Vessels_, is dubious.
For, on the one hand, because they emit no _Sap_, or _bleed_ not,
and also stand adjacent to the _Aer_; ’tis probable that they
are _Aer-Vessels_. On the other hand, they may be _Sap-Vessels_;
notwithstanding that they _bleed_ not: Because the non-emission of
_Sap_ is not an infallible and concluding argument of an _Aer-Vessel_.
For there are some _Plants_ which _bleed_ not. Which yet are furnished
with _Sap-Vessels_, as certainly as any others which _bleed_.[58]

     [58] _B. 2. P. 1. c. 3. §. 22._

5. §. The _Skin_ of the _Trunk_ is sometimes visibly porous. But no
where more, than in the better sort of walking _Canes_; where the
_Pores_ are so big, as to be visible even to the naked Eye: like to
those, ♦ _Tab. 20._ ♦ which are observable in several parts of the Ball
of the _Hand_, and upon the ends of the _Fingers_ and _Toes_.


6. §. THE _Main Body_ of the _Barque_ consisteth likewise of two
_Parts_, _sc._ _Parenchyma_, and _Vessels_. The _Parenchyma_ is made
up of an innumerable company of small _Bladders_ cluster’d together.
Differing in nothing from those aforesaid in the _Skin_; ♦ _Tab. 22. &
Sequent._ ♦ saving, that they are much larger; and generally rounder.

7. §. This _Parenchyma_ of the _Barque_ is the same, as to its
_Substance_, both in the _Root_ and _Trunk_. Yet as to the _Texture_
of its _Parts_, in the _one_, and in the _other_, there _is_ This
observable difference, _viz._ That in the _Barque_ of the _Root_,
cut transversly, the said _Parenchyma_ (as hath been shew’d) is
usually, more or less, disposed into _Diametral Rays_; ♦ _Tab. 7, 8,
9._ ♦ running through the _Barque_, after the same manner, as do the
_Hour-Lines_ through the Margin of the _Dial-plate_ of a _Clock_ or
_Watch_: as in _Marsh-Mallow_, _Lovage_, _Melilot_, and others. Whereas
here in the _Barque_ of the _Trunk_, the said _Parenchyma_ is rarely
thus disposed into _Diametral Rays_: ♦ _Tab. 22. & Seq._ ♦ Nor when it
is, are those _Rays_ continued to the Circumference of the _Barque_;
as in the _Barque_ of the _Root_ they frequently are. ♦ _Tab. 31, 34,
&c._ ♦ So in _Rhus_ or _Sumach_, although part of the _Parenchyma_
be dispos’d into _Diametral Rays_: yet are those _Rays_ extended not
half way through the _Barque_. So also in _Fig-tree_, _Worm-wood_,
_Thistle_, and others. What is further observable in the _Texture_ of
the _Parenchyma_, I shall shew in the description of the _Pith_.


8. §. THE _Vessels_ of the _Barque_, are, as I shall also shew,
diversifyed many ways. But there are some Things, wherein, in all Sorts
of _Plants_, they agree. _First_, in standing, most numerously, in or
near, the inner Margin of the _Barque_. _Secondly_, in being always,
and only _Sap-Vessels_. I have viewed so many, that at least, I can
securely affirm thus much, That if there be any Heteroclital _Plants_,
wherein they are found otherwise, there is not _One_, in _Five
Hundred_. _Thirdly_, in being always _Conjugated_ or _Braced_ together
in the form of _Net-work_. Although the Number and Distances of the
_Braces_, are very different: ♦ _Chap. 3. Tab. 6._ ♦ as I have already
shewed in the _Anatomy_ of _Roots_.


9. §. THE Properties, whereby the said _Vessels_ of the _Barque_ are
specificated and distinguished one from another, both in the same
_Plant_, and in the several Species of _Plants_, are very many. Which
Properties, are not Accidental, but such as shew the Constant and
Universal Design of _Nature_. All which shall be demonstrated by the
_Description_ of several _Quarters_ of the _Slices_, of so many Kinds
of _Branches_, cut Transversly: and by the several _Figures_ which
represent them.


10. §. FIRST then, for the _Eleven_ first _Quarters_, the _Vessels_ of
the _Barque_ are only of _Two Kinds_. ♦ _Tab. 22. & Seq._ ♦ And these,
in the first _Eight_, seem to be _Roriferous_ (described also in the
_Anatomy_ of _Roots_)[59] and those which are common to most, if not to
all _Plants_, sc. the _Lymphæducts_. Yet in all the _Eight_, they are,
in respect both of their _Proportion_, and _Position_, very different.
So in _Hazel_ and _Ash_ they are but few. In _Holly_ and _Barberry_
more. In _Apple_, _Pear_, _Plum_, _Elm_, still more numerous. And of
those three _Fruits_, in an _Apple_, or _Plum_, more than in a _Pear_.

     [59] _P. 1. c. 3. §. 22._

11. §. Again, as their _Proportion_, so likewise their _Position_ is
divers. For in _Holly_, the _Lymphæducts_ or inner _Vessels_ next to
the _Wood_, stand in _Rays_. Yet so numerous and close together, as
to make one Entire _Ring_. ♦ _Tab. 22, 23, 24._ ♦ In _Hazel_, they
stand more in Oblong _Parcels_. In _Barberry_, they stand likewise in
_Parcels_, but they are so many _Half-Ovals_. The utmost _Vessels_ or
_Roriferous_ of all Three, make a _Ring_.

12. §. Again, in _Apple_, _Pear_, and _Plum_, the _Lymphæducts_
are _Radiated_. The _Roriferous_ are neither _Radiated_, nor make
an _entire Ring_; ♦ _Tab. 25, to 28._ ♦ but stand in _Peripherial
Parcels_. Much after the same manner, they also stand in _Elm_. In
_Ash_, the _Vessels_ make Two _Rings_; ♦ _Tab. 29._ ♦ but neither of
them _Radiated_: the inmost _Ring_ or _Lymphæducts_, consisting of
_Arched Parcels_, and the utmost or _Roriferous Vessels_, of _Round_
ones. And whereas in all the foregoing, the _Lymphæducts_ are still
contiguous to the _Wood_; and the _Roriferous_ more or less, distant
from the _Skin_: here, on the contrary, the former are distant from the
_Wood_, and the latter contiguous to the _Skin_.

13. §. And that these _Vessels_ in each _Barque_ of the said Eight
_Branches_, are of Two distinct Kinds, seems evident, as from some
other reasons, so from hence; In that their _Positions_ are altogether
Heterogeneous: Yet in both Constant, Regular and Uniform. I say,
there seems to be no Reason, why the self _same Kind_ or Species of
_Vessels_, should have a different, yea a contrary _Position_ in one
and the same _Plant_; and that Contrariety, not _Accidental_, but
_Regular_ and _Constant_.


14. §. FOR the _Three_ next _Quarters_ _sc._ the _Ninth_, _Tenth_
and _Eleventh_, the _Vessels_ of the _Barque_ are also different in
_Number_, _Position_, _Size_ and _Kind_. ♦ _Tab. 30, 31, 32._ ♦ In
_Pine_, which is the _Eleventh_, they are fewer. In _Walnut_, the
_Ninth_, more. In _Fig_, the _Tenth_, most numerous.

15. §. So for their _Position_. In _Pine_, the inmost make a _Radiated
Ring_. The utmost stand _stragling_ up and down, without any certain
order. In _Wallnut_ the inmost make also a _Radiated Ring_; The utmost
make a Double _Ring_; not _Radiated_, but of _Round Parcels_. In _Fig_,
the inmost make also a _Radiated Ring_. But the utmost make a _Double_
and sometimes _Treble Ring_, not of _Radiated_, nor _Round_, but
_Arched Parcels_.

16. §. Thirdly, they are also different in _Kind_. Those, I think,
of the two former, _Wallnut_ and _Fig_, are thus different: those
certainly, of the _Fig_, are so; being _Lymphæducts_ and _Lacteals_.
The _Lymphæducts_ make the inmost _Radiated Ring_. The outmost which
make the other _Rings_ in _Arched Parcels_, are the _Lactifers_.

17. §. That they are distinct _Kinds_ of _Vessels_, is evident for
two Reasons. _First_, from their _Position_ in the _Barque_; which is
altogether different, as hath been said. _Secondly_, from the most
apparent Diversity of the _Liquors_ or _Saps_, which they contain, and
which, upon cutting the _Branch_ transversly, do distinctly _Bleed_
from them. Which is one way, whereby we do distinguish the _Vessels_
of _Animals_ themselves. As in the _Liver_, it were hard to say, which
is a _Blood-Vessel_, and which is a _Bile-Vessel_, where they are very
small, if it were not for the _Contents_ of them both.

18. §. Those in the _Barque_ of _Pine_, are likewise of Two _Kinds_.
The inmost are _Lymphæducts_, as in the two former. The utmost are
not _Milk-Vessels_, but _Gum-Vessels_, or _Resiniferous_; which stand
stragling, and singly, about the midle of the _Barque_. Out of these
_Vessels_ all the clear _Turpentine_, that drops from the _Tree_, doth
issue.

19. §. Few, but very great. So that besides the difference of their
_Number_ and _Position_, and of the _Liquors_ which they contain,
and _Bleed_; there is yet a Fourth, and that is, their _Size_. Most
of these _Turpentine Vessels_, being of so wide a _bore_, as to be
apparent to the naked Eye: and, through a good _Glass_, above ⅓ᵈ of
an Inch in Diametre. Whereas that of the _Lymphæducts_, can hardly be
discovered by the best _Microscope_.

20. §. The same _Turpentine-Vessels_ of _Pine_, are likewise remarkably
bigger, not only than the _Lymphæducts_, but many times, than the
_Milk-Vessels_ themselves: as those of the _Fig_, which, in comparison,
are exceeding small; every _Arch_, not being a _single Vessel_, but a
_Parcel_ or _Cluster_ of _Vessels_; Whereas one single _Gum-Vessel_
in _Pine_, is sometimes as big as two whole _Arched Clusters_, that
is, as some Scores of the _Milk Vessels_ in a _Fig-tree_. And the said
_Gum-Vessels_ of _Pine_, being compared with the _Lymphæducts_ of the
same _Tree_, one _Gum-Vessel_, by a moderate estimate, may be reckoned
_three_ or _four hundred_ times _wider_ than a _Lymphæduct_. The like
prodigious difference may be observed in the _Size_ of the several
_Kinds_ of _Vessels_ of many other _Plants_.


21. §. THE _Three_ next _Quarters_ of _Branches_, are of _Oak_, _Common
Sumach_, and _Common Wormwood_. In the _Barque-Vessels_ whereof, there
is observable some farther Variety. For in all or in most of the above
named, there are only Two _Kinds_ of _Vessels_ in the _Barque_. But in
Each of these, there are, at least, Three _Kinds_.

22. §. And first, in that of _Oak_ there are _Lymphæducts_,
_Roriferous_, and a Sort of _Resiniferous_. ♦ _Tab. 33._ ♦ The inmost
or _Lymphæducts_, make a _Radiated Ring_, contiguous to the _Wood_.
The utmost or the _Roriferous_ make also a _Ring_, but not _Radiated_.
Those which are a sort of _Rosin-Vessels_, stand in Round _Parcels_;
the greater _Parcels_ betwixt the Two _Rings_ of _Roriferous_ and
_Lymphæducts_; and the lesser, betwixt the _Roriferous_ and the _Skin_.

23. §. That these last are different _Vessels_ from both the other,
seems evident, from the difference of their _Position_, as aforesaid.
And that they are a sort of _Resiniferous_, is argued from hence; In
that, not only _Galls_ are very full of _Rosin_, but that the _Barque_
of _Oak_ it self is also somewhat _Resinous_. For the conveyance of
whose _Resinous_ parts, it is most unlikely that any other _Vessels_
should subserve, but a peculiar _Kind_; which may therefore be properly
called _Resiniferous_.

♦ _Tab. 34._ ♦ 24. §. The next is a _Branch_ of _Common Sumach_. In the
_Barque_ whereof, there are likewise Three _Kinds_ of _Vessels_. First
of all, there is a thick _Radiated Ring_ of _Lymphæducts_; standing on
the inner _Margin_ of the _Barque_, contiguous with the _Wood_. These
_Vessels_ exhibit their _Lympha_ very apparently. A second kind of
_Vessels_, _sc._ _Roriferous_, are situate towards the outer _Margin_
of the _Barque_, and are composed into distinct _Arched Parcels_, all
standing in a _Ring_.

25. §. Betwixt these Two _Kinds_ stand the _Milk-Vessels_. Every
single _Milk-Vessel_ being _empaled_ or hemmed in with an _Arch_ of
_Roriferous_. The _Milk-Vessels_ are extraordinary large, almost as
the _Gum-Vessels_ of _Pine_; so as distinctly to be observed without
a _Microscope_; after they are evacuated of their _Milk_; and without
difficulty will admit a _Virginal Wyer_; being two or three hundred
times as big as a _Lymphæduct_. Besides these Three sorts of _Vessels_,
there is also a _Ring_, adjacent to the _Skin_; which seems to be
another sort of _Roriferous_.

26. §. The Last, is a _Branch_ of _Common Wormwood_. ♦ _Tab. 35._ ♦ In
the _Barque_ whereof, there are likewise Three _Kinds_ of _Vessels_.
First of all, there is a thin _Radiated Ring_ of _Lymphæducts_,
contiguous with the _Wood_ or on the inner _Margin_ of the _Barque_.
Yet the _Ring_ is not entire, but made up of several _Parcels_; which
are intercepted by as many _Parenchymous_ inserted into the _Pith_.

27. §. A Second Sort of _Vessels_, which seem to be _Roriferous_, are
situate about the middle of the _Barque_: and are composed into _Arched
Parcels_, which likewise stand all even in a _Ring_.

28. §. Beyond these _Arches_, and towards the outer _Margin_ of
the _Barque_, stand a Third Sort of _Vessels_. Different from the
_Milk-Vessels_ in _Sumach_, both as to their _Situation_, _Size_
and _Content_. For in _Sumach_, the _Milk-Vessels_ stand within the
_Arched Lymphæducts_: whereas these in _Wormwood_, stand without them.
Likewise, being the _Vessels_ of an _Herb_, they are far less; _sc._
about the compass or width of a small _Wheat-Straw_. Their _Content_,
is not a _Milk_, but a _liquid_, most _Oleous_ and _viscid Gum_. Or
which, for its pleasant _Flavour_ may be called an _Aromatick Balsom_.
For it perfectly giveth whatever is in the _Smell_ and _Taste_ of
_Wormwood_: being the _Essence_ of the whole _Plant_, which nature
treasureth up in these _Vessels_. So that they are, in all respects,
analogous to the _Turpentine Vessels_ in _Pine_. There are divers
other _Herbs_ and _Trees_, which in the like _Vessels_, contain a
_Turpentine_, or rather _Aromatical Balsom_; as _Angelica_, _Helenium_
and others; the _Vessels_ being so very large, that they may be easily
traced with a knife, in cutting by the length of a _Branch_ or _Stalk_.

29. §. Whether in some _Plants_, there are not more _Sorts_ of
_Vessels_, in the _Barque_, than have been now mentioned, I cannot say:
Though we have not much reason to doubt of it. Because we see, there is
so great variety in the _Viscera_ of _Animals_. For what the _Viscera_
are in _Animals_; the _Vessels_ themselves are in _Plants_.


30. §. CONCERNING the _Form_ and _Texture_ of the _Lymphæducts_, there
are some things, which though they are best observed in the _Wood_,
yet in regard I am now describing the said _Vessels_, I shall here
therefore add. I have already said, and shewed, in the former _Books_,
That the _Lignous_ and _Towy Parts_ of all _Plants_, are _Tubulary_.
And that the _Lympha_ is conveyed, by the length of a _Plant_, through
an innumerable company of small _Tubes_ or _Pipes_.

31. §. The _Question_ may be yet further put: If the _Towy Parts_ of
the _Barque_ are made of _Tubes_, What are these _Tubes_ themselves
made up of? _I answer_, That these _Tubes_ or _Lymphæducts_, are
not only themselves _Organical_; but their very _Sides_ also, seem
to be composed of other _Parts_, which are _Organical_, _sc._ of
_Lignous_ or _Towy Fibres_. ♦ _Tab. 40._ ♦ Which _Fibres_, standing
close or contiguous in a round _Figure_, they make one _Tubulary
Body_, which I call the _Lymphæduct_ of a _Plant_. And it is probable,
That these _Fibres_ themselves, are also _Tubulary_. That is, that a
_Lymphæduct_, is a small _Tube_, made up or composed of other, yet
much smaller _Tubes_, set round together in a _Cylindrick Figure_. As
if we should imagine a company of _Straws_, which are so many small
_Pipes_, to be joyned and set round together, so as to make another
greater _Pipe_, answerable to a _hollow Cane_. The _Cane_, I say, is
as the _Lymphæduct_; and the _Straws_ are as the _Fibres_ whereof it
is composed. By which also appears, the admirable smallness of these
_Fibres_. For there are some _Lymphæducts_, which may be reckoned fifty
times smaller than a _Horse-Hair_. Allowing therefore but Twenty of
the aforesaid _Fibres_ to make a _Thred_ so big as one _Lymphæduct_;
then one of the said _Fibres_, must be a Thousand times smaller than a
_Horse-Hair_. That these _Fibres_, whereof the _Lymphæducts_ are made,
are themselves made up of other _Fibres_, is not altogether improbable.

32. §. These _Fibres_, although parallel; yet are they not
_coalescent_, but only contiguous; being contained together in a
_Tubulary Figure_, by the Weftage of the _Cortical Fibres_, as in
_Chapter_ the _Fourth_ will better be understood.

33. §. The first notice I took of the _Composition_ and _Texture_ of
these _Vessels_, so far as the best _Glasses_ yet known, will admit;
was in a very _white_ and _clear_ piece of _Ash-wood_ torn, with some
care, by the length of the _Tree_, and objected to a proper _Light_.
They seem also sometimes discernable in some other _clear Woods_, as
in very _white Fir_, _&c._ And having formerly demonstrated, that the
_Lignous Part_ of a _Plant_, is annually made or augmented out of the
inner part of the _Barque_, wherein the _Lymphæducts_ always stand:
we may reasonably suppose the same _Lymphæducts_ to have the like
Conformation in the _Barque_, as in the _Wood_.

34. §. And I am the rather induced to believe, that I am not mistaken
in this Description, upon these two Considerations. _First_, that
herein the Analogy betwixt the _Vessels_ of an _Animal_ and a _Plant_,
is the more clear and proper. For as the _Sanguineous Vessels_ in
an _Animal_ are composed of a number of _Fibres_, set round, in a
_Tubulary Figure_, together: so are these _Lymphæducts_ of a _Plant_.
_Secondly_, in that herein, there is a more genuine respondence betwixt
these, and the other _Vessels_ of a _Plant_ it self; _sc._, the
_Aer-Vessels_; which are made up of a certain number of _Round Fibres_,
standing collaterally, or side to side as I have already observed in
the _Anatomy_ of _Roots_. So that it is the less strange, that the
_Lymphæducts_ should be made up of _Fibres_, since the _Aer-Vessels_
are evidently so made. Only with this difference, that whereas in the
_Aer-Vessels_, the _Fibres_ are postured or continued _Spirally_: here,
in the _Lymphæducts_, they stand and are continued only in _straight
Lines_.


35. §. THE STRUCTURE of the _Lactiferous_ and _Gum-Vessels_, which
have a very ample _Bore_, is more apparent. ♦ _Tab. 20._ ♦ And, by
the best _Glasses_ I have yet used, they seem to be made, chiefly, by
the Constipation of the _Bladders_ of the _Barque_. That is to say,
That they are so many _Chanels_, not made or bounded by any walls or
sides proper to themselves, as a _Quil_ thrust into a _Cork_, and as
the _Aer-Vessels_ are in the _Wood_: but only by the _Bladders_ of the
_Parenchyma_; which are so postured and crouded up together, as to
leave certain _Cilyndrick Spaces_, which are continued by the length of
the _Barque_.

36. §. One difference betwixt the _Vessels_ or _Chanels_ now describ’d,
and the Tubulary _Hollows_ and other _Apertures_ in the _Pith_, is
this; That these never exist originally with the _Pith_; but are so
many _Ruptures_ supervening to it in its Growth. Caused, partly, by the
Stretch or Tenter it suffers from the Dilatation of the _Wood_:[60]
and partly, the drying, and so the Shrinking up of its _Bladders_, and
of the _Fibres_ whereof they are composed. Whereas the said _Vessels_
in the _Barque_, are many of them originally formed therewith. And
those which are _post-nate_, not made by any _Rupture_, but only such
a Disposition of the _Parenchymous Fibres_, and Constipation of the
_Bladders_, as is thereunto convenient.

     [60] _B. 1. c. 3. §. 22, & 23._

37. §. In paring the _Barque_ of a _Branch_ of _Pine_, _Sumach_, &c.
they appear, neither _parallel_, nor any where _Inosculated_: but run,
with some little obliquities, distinct one from another, through the
length of the _Branch_: and so, we may believe, through the length of
the _Tree_.




                               CHAP. III.

                             _Of the WOOD._


THE next general _Part_ of a _Branch_, is the _Wood_; which lyeth
betwixt the _Barque_ and the _Pith_. And this likewise evermore
consisteth of Two General _Parts_, _sc._ of a _Parenchymous Part_, and
that more properly called _Lignous_. The _Parenchymous Part_ of the
_Wood_, though much diversifyed, yet in the _Trunks_ of all _Trees_
whatsoever, hath this property, To be disposed into many _Rays_, or
_Diametral Insertions_, running betwixt so many _Lignous Portions_,
from the _Barque_ to the _Pith_: as in any of the _Quarters_ here
before us may appear.

2. §. But these _Insertions_ are much diversifyed, according to
the several _Sorts_ of _Plants_. So in _Barberry_, _Ash_, _Pine_,
_Worm-wood_, they are less numerous. ♦ _Tab._ 22, to 35. ♦ In _Elm_,
_Wallnut_, _Fig_, _Sumach_, they are more. And in _Holly_, _Pear_,
_Plum_, _Apple_, _Oak_, _Hazel_, are most numerous.

3. §. The same _Insertions_, in _Barberry_, _Wormwood_, and some in
_Oak_, are very Thick. In _Pine_, _Fig_, _Ash_, of a middle _Size_.
In _Pear_, _Holly_, and most of them in _Oak_, are exceeding Small. ♦
_Ibid._ ♦ Again, in _Barberry_, _Elm_, _Ash_, _Sumach_, _Fig_, they
are of an Equal _Size_. In _Holly_, _Hazel_, _Pear_, _Plum_, _Oak_,
they are very Unequal: some of those in _Holly_, being _Four_ or _Five_
times thicker than the rest; in _Plum_, _Six_ or _Seven_ times; and in
_Oak_, _Ten_ times at least.

4. §. In some _Plants_, they are Equidistant; in others, not: in some,
the Great ones are Equidistant; in others, the Lesser; in others, both;
in some, neither. Which _Varieties_ are not accidental; but constant to
the _Species_ in which they are severally found.

5. §. They are not always visibly continued from the Circumference
to the Centre of the _Wood_: but in some _Branches_, as of _Sumach_;
and in most _Trunks_ of many years growth, declining, in some places,
♦ _Tab. 34._ ♦ under or over, from a Level, are thereby, upon a
Transverse Section, in part cut away.

6. §. They have yet one more Diversity, which is, That in divers of the
aforesaid _Branches_, they run not only through the _Wood_; but also
shoot out beyond it, into some _Part_ of the _Barque_, as in _Elm_,
_Sumach_, _Wormwood_, &c. ♦ _Tab. 28, 34, 35._ ♦ Whereas in _Pine_, and
some of the rest they either keep not distinct from the other parts of
the _Parenchyma_ of the _Barque_; ♦ _Tab. 32._ ♦ or are so small, as
not to be distinguished there from.

7. §. The _Texture_ likewise of these _Insertions_ is somewhat various.
♦ _Tab. 35._ ♦ For in _Wormwood_, and most _Herbs_, they are manifestly
composed of small _Bladders_: differing in nothing from those of the
_Barque_ or _Pith_, saving, in their being much less. Yet in _Herbs_,
they are much larger than they are in _Trees_. ♦ _Tab. 36, 37._ ♦ And
in many _Trees_, as _Apple_, _Pear_, _Plum_, _Pine_, &c. they are
either quite lost, or so squeezed and pressed together by the hard
_Wood_ standing on both sides, as to be almost undiscernable.

8. §. So that although the _Parenchyma_ of the _Barque_ or _Pith_, and
the _Insertions_ in the _Wood_, are of the same _Specifick_ Nature or
Substance: yet there is this difference betwixt them; That the _Fibres_
of the former, are so Netted together, as to leave several round
Vacuities; or to make a great many little _Bladders_, whereas, in the
latter, they are usually so far crowded up, as to run (as when a Net is
stretched out) like a _Skein_ of _Parallel Threds_.

9. §. Of these _Insertions_ in the _Wood_, it is further observable,
That they do not only run betwixt the _Lignous Portions_; but that many
of their _Fibres_ are likewise all along distributed to the several
_Fibres_, ♦ _Tab. 40._ ♦ of which the _Lignous Portions_ consist,
and are interwoven with them; both together thus making a piece of
_Linsy-Woolsy Work_, or like many other _Manufactures_ in which the
_Warp_ and the _Woof_ are of different Sorts of _Stuff_: as in the end
of the _Fourth Chapter_ is further explained.


10. §. THE WOOD is likewise compounded of Two Sorts of _Bodies_; That
which is strictly _Woody_; and the _Aer-Vessels_ mixed herewith. The
true _Wood_ is nothing else but a mass of antiquated _Lymphæducts_,
_viz._ those which were originally placed on the inner Margin of the
_Barque_. For in that place, there grows, every year, a new _Ring_ of
_Lymphæducts_. Which losing its original softness by degrees, at the
latter end of the year, is turned into a dry and hard _Ring_ of perfect
_Wood_.

11. §. So that every year, the _Barque_ of a _Tree_ is divided into
Two Parts, and distributed two _contrary_ ways. The outer Part falleth
off towards the _Skin_; and at length becomes the _Skin_ it self. In
like manner, as hath been observed of the _Skin_ of the _Root_. Or as
the _Cuticula_ in _Animals_, is but the efflorescence of the _Cutis_.
I say, that the elder _Skin_ of a _Tree_, is not originally made a
_Skin_; but was once, some of the _midle_ part of the _Barque_ it
self, which is annually cast off, and dryed into a _Skin_: even as
the very _Skin_ of an _Adder_, upon the gradual generation of a new
one underneath, in time, becomes a _Slough_. The inmost portion of
the _Barque_, is annually distributed and added to the _Wood_: the
_Parenchymous Part_ thereof making a new addition to the _Insertions_
within the _Wood_; and the _Lymphæducts_ a new addition to the _Lignous
pieces_ betwixt which the _Insertions_ stand. So that a _Ring_ of
_Lymphæducts_ in the _Barque_ this year, will be a _Ring_ of _Wood_
the next; and so another _Ring_ of _Lymphæducts_, and of _Wood_,
successively, from year to year. So the _Table_, for an _Apple-Branch_,
♦ _Tab. 25, 24, 34, 28._ ♦ sheweth a quarter of a _Slice_ of a _Branch_
cut transversly, of Three years growth: That of _Barbery_, of Two; That
of _Sumach_, of One only; That of _Elm_, of Five.

12. §. Hereby two things maybe the better noted. First, the difference
betwixt the degrees of the _annual_ growths of several _Trees_: three
years growth in an _Oak_, being as thick as five in an _Elm_. ♦ _Tab.
33, 28._ ♦ Secondly, the difference betwixt the _Annual_ growths of
the _same Tree_; being not of a constant proportion, but varying in
thickness, as it should seem, according to the _season_ of the year:
whereby it may appear, what _season_, or kind of year, doth most of all
favour, the latitudinal growth, or the _thickening_ of any _Tree_.

13. §. The _Lymphæducts_ thus antiquated or turned into _Wood_, do
rarely, if ever, _Bleed_: but only transmit a kind of _Dewy_ or
_Vaporous Sap_. And some of them, as in the _Heart_ of some _Trees_,
it is probable, That they transmit not any _Sap_, either in the form
of a _Liquor_, or a _Vapour_: and so being gradually deprived of their
_Watery Parts_, become the _Heart_.

14. §. There is this further variety in the _Wood_; represented in
_Walnut_, _Fig_ and _Oak_. That some certain parcels hereof, make
either several small and white _Rings_, as in _Oak_; or else divers
white and crooked _Parcels_, transverse to the _Insertions_, as in
_Wallnut_ and _Fig_. ♦ _Tab. 30, 31, 33._ ♦ For it seemeth, that, at
least,in many _Trees_, some portion of all the _Kinds_ of _Vessels_
in the _Barque_, are not only annually distributed to the _Wood_, but
do likewise therein retain the same, or somewhat like _Position_,
which they originally had in the _Barque_. So that as all those bigger
and darker Portions of the _Wood_, were originally, the _Radiated
Lymphæducts_ of the _Barque_: so the little white _Circles_, or
_Parcels_ of _Circles_, in the same _Wood_, were originally another
sort of _Sap-Vessels_ in the _Barque_, _sc._ those which have a
circular Position therein.

15. §. In the _Branches_ of _Fir_, _Pine_, and others of the same
_Kindred_, there are some few _Turpentine-Vessels_ scattered up and
down the _Wood_; ♦ _Tab. 32._ ♦ and represented by the larger Black
Spots. Which _Vessels_ are _eadem numero_, the self same, which did
once appertain to the _Barque_; and do even here also in the _Wood_,
contain and yield a liquid _Turpentine_. Only, being pinched up by the
_Wood_, they are become much smaller _Pipes_.


16. §. THE _Aer-Vessels_, with the _Insertions_, and true _Wood_,
altogether make up That, which is commonly called, The _Wood_ of a
_Tree_. The _Aer-Vessels_ I so call, not in that they never contain
any _Liquor_; but, because all the principal time of the growth of a
_Plant_, when the _Vessels_ of the _Barque_ are filled with _Liquor_,
these are filled only with a _Vegetable Aer_.

17. §. In almost all _Plants_, not one in some hundreds excepted, this
is proper to the _Aer-Vessels_; To have a much more ample _Bore_ or
_Cavity_, than any other in the _Wood_. In the _Wood_, I say; for in
the _Barque_, there are many _Sap-Vessels_ bigger than the biggest
_Aer-Vessels_ that be.

18. §. The Varieties hereof are very many; in respect both of their
_Number_, _Size_, and _Position_; being, as to these, the same, in
no two _Sorts_ of _Plants_ whatsoever. First in respect of their
_Number_. So in _Hazel_, _Apple_, _Pear_, they are very numerous; but
in different degrees: and are represented in the _Figures_ already
referred to, by all the black spots in the _Wood_. ♦ _Tab. 23, 25, 26.
22, 24, 27. 29, 30, 33. 32._ ♦ In _Holly_, _Plum_, _Barberry_ somewhat
numerous. In _Oak_, _Ash_, _Walnut_ fewer. In _Pine_, and others of
that _Kindred_, very few; _sc._ fewer than in any other kind of _Plant_.

19. §. Secondly, in respect of their _Size_; which from the first or
greatest, to the least, may be computed easily to about Twenty Degrees.
Thus, many of those in _Elm_, _Ash_, _Wallnut_, _Fig_, _Oak_, are very
large. In _Barberry_, _Plum_, not so large. In _Hazel_, _Sumach_,
smaller. In _Holly_, _Pear_, of a still smaller _Size_. ♦ _Tab. 28, 33.
22, 26._ ♦ So that many of those in _Elm_, or _Oak_, are Twenty times
bigger, than those in _Holly_ or _Pear_.

20. §. In an ordinary joynted _Cane_, they are so wide, that if you
take one a yard, or a yard and ½ long, and putting one end into a Basin
of Water, you blow strongly at the other; your Breath will immediately
pass, through the _Aer-Vessels_, the length of the _Cane_, so as to
raise up the Water into a great many _Bubbles_.

21. §. And as they have a different Size in divers Kinds of _Plants_;
so likewise, according to the place where they stand, in the self same.
So in _Holly_, _Hazel_, _Apple_, their _Size_ is more equal throughout
the bredth of the _Tree_. ♦ _Tab. 22, 23, 25. 24, 28, 29. 33._ ♦ But
in _Barberry_, _Elm_, _Oak_, _Ash_, very different: Not fortuitously,
but always much after the same manner. For in all the last named
_Branches_, the _Aer-Vessels_ stand in the inner _margin_ of each
annual _Ring_, are all vastly bigger, than any of those that stand in
the outer part of the _Ring_.

22. §. Thirdly, these _Aer-Vessels_ are also different in their
_Situation_. So in _Apple_, _Wallnut_, _Fig_, they are spread all
abroad in every annual _Ring_; ♦ _Tab. 25, 30, 31._ ♦ not being posited
in any one certain _Line_. In others, they keep more within the compass
of some _Line_ or _Lines_; either _Diametral_, or _Peripheral_. ♦
_Tab. 22. 23, 32._ ♦ So in _Holly_ they are _Radiated_, or run in even
_Diametral Lines_ betwixt the _Pith_ and the _Barque_. So also are some
of them in _Hazel_; and some few in _Wallnut_.

23. §. Whether they stand _Irregularly_, or are _Radiated_, it is to be
noted, That Nature, for the most part, so disposeth of them, that many
of them may still stand very near the _Insertions_. So in _Apple_, she
will rather decline making an even _Line_; or in _Holly_, will rather
break that _Line_ into _Parcels_, than that the _Aer-Vessels_ shall
stand remote from the _Insertions_. To what end this is done, shall be
said hereafter.

24. §. Again, in _Ash_, the _Aer-Vessels_ are none of them _Radiated_,
but most of them stand in _Circles_ on the inner _Margin_ of every
annual _Ring_. ♦ _Tab. 24. 29. 28. 26, 27._ ♦ Which _Circle_ is
sometimes very thick, as in _Ash_ and _Barberry_. In others but thin,
the _Vessels_ standing, for the most part, single throughout the
_Circles_; as in _Elm_. Sometimes again, they both make a _Circle_, and
are also spread abroad; as in _Pear_ and _Plum_.

25. §. Those likewise which are spread abroad, are sometimes
_Regularly_ posited. ♦ _Tab. 24._ ♦ So in _Barberry_, besides those
larger, that make the _Circle_, there are other smaller ones, that
stand, in oblique _Lines_, athwart one another; almost like a _Bend_,
or sometimes, an entire or broken _Saltyr_ in an _Escutcheon_. ♦
_Tab. 33. 38._ ♦ In _Oak_, they make rather certain _Columns_, in the
posture of the _Pale_. And in _Elm_, they make, as it were, many _cross
Parcels_, in the posture of the _Fess_.

26. §. This great difference in the _Size_ and _Position_ of the
_Aer-Vessels_, in the same individual _Plant_, is one ground,
for which, I think it probable, That there are _divers Kinds_ of
_Aer-Vessels_, as well as of _Sap-Vessels_. Even as in _Animals_, there
are divers _Kinds_ of _Organs_ for _Spiration_, and the separation of
_Aer_: _Fishes_ having their _Branchiæ_; _Land-Animals_ their _Lungs_;
and those in _Frogs_, _&c._ being of a somewhat peculiar _Kind_.


27. §. THE _Form_ and _Texture_ of these _Vessels_, and the various
ways whereby they may be best observed, I have already described and
shewed in my _Anatomy_ of _Roots_. ♦ _P. 1. c. 4._ ♦ As to their
_Form_, one thing remarqued was this; That they are never _Ramified_,
but distinctly continued from one end of a _Plant_, small or great,
to the other: as the _Nerves_ are in _Animals_. A further and easie
proof whereof, may be made, only by holding up a piece of an ordinary
_Cane_, about ½ a foot long, cut very smooth at both ends, against a
full light: whereupon, if you keep it in a straight _Line_ betwixt the
_Light_, and the cast of your _Eye_, and then look steadily, you may
see quite through it, that is, through the _Aer-Vessels_, which run
straight along the _Cane_ from end to end.

28. §. As to their _Texture_; whereas, oftentimes, the _Aer-Vessels_
appear to be _unroaved_ in the form of a very small _Plate_, it is to
be noted, That it is not only of different bredth, in divers _Plants_,
and usually much broader in the _Root_, than in the _Trunk_: but also,
that in the _Trunk_, many times, the said _Vessels_ are unroaved or
resolved, not in the form of a _Plate_, but of a _Round-Thred_. The
Causes of which Diversity, are principally Three; _viz._ The _Weftage_
of the _Fibres_ of which the _Aer-Vessels_ consist; The deference
betwixt the said _Fibres_, or betwixt the _Warp_ and the _Woof_; And
the different _Kinds_ of _Woof_.

29. §. By the _Weftage_ of the _Fibres_, it is, That the _Vessels_,
oftentimes, _unroave_ in the form of a _Plate_. As if we should imagine
a piece of fine narrow _Ribband_, to be woun’d spirally, and Edg to
Edg, round about a Stick; and so, the Stick being drawn out, the
_Ribband_ to be left in the _Figure_ of a _Tube_, answerable to an
_Aer-Vessel_. For that which, upon the _unroaving_ of the _Vessel_,
seems to be a _Plate_, ♦ _Tab. 39._ ♦ or one single _Piece_, is, as it
were, a _Natural Ribband_, consisting of several Pieces, that is, a
certain number of _Threds_ or _Round Fibres_, standing parallel, as the
_Threds_ do in an _Artificial Ribband_. And as in a _Ribband_, so here,
the _Fibres_ which make the _Warp_, and which are Spirally continu’d;
although they run parallel, yet are not coallescent; but conteined
together, by other Transverse _Fibres_ in the place of a _Woof_.

30. §. And as the said _Fibres_ are transversly continued, thereby
making a _Warp_ and _Woof_: So are they (as in divers woven
_Manufactures_) of very different _Bulk_; those of the Former, being
much bigger, and therefore much stronger, than those of the Latter.
By which means, as _Cloth_ or _Silk_ will often Tear one way, and not
another; so here, while the _Warp_ or those _Fibres_ which are Spirally
continued, are usually _unroaved_ without breaking; those smaller
ones, by which they are _stitched_ or _woven_ together, easily tear in
sunder all the way.

31. §. And because the _Fibres_ of the _Woof_, are themselves also of
different _Bulk_; therefore it is, That where they are more sturdy,
as usually in the _Root_, they require a greater quantity of _Warp_,
that is, a broader _Plate_, to overmatch them. Whereas, where they are
more extream small, as in the _Trunk_ and _Leaves_, one _Thred_ of the
_Warp_, that is, one _Spiral Fibre_, will be strong enough of it self,
and so, sometimes, be singly _unroav’d_.

32. §. From the extream Tenuity of these _Fibres_, it is, That they
are very rarely discern’d, and not without the greatest difficulty. As
also, from their great Tenderness; whereby not enduring to be drawn
out, they all break off close to the Sides of the _Spiral ones_. In the
_Pith_, the like Transverse _Fibres_ are a little more visible: which
first conducted Me to the notice of them here also.

33. §. All the _Fibres_ of the _Aer-Vessels_, both the _Warp_ and
the _Woof_, are of the same Substantial Nature with the _Pith_ and
the other _Parenchymous Parts_ of a _Plant_. From whence it is, That
whereas the _Towy Parts_ of a _Plant_, whereof all _Linen Manufactures_
are made, are very _Strong_ and _Tough_; these, as is abovesaid, are
extream _Tender_ and _Brittle_, like those of the _Pith_ and all
the _Pithy Parts_. To which therefore, the _Aer-Vessels_ are to be
referr’d. And the _Content_ of both, is oftentimes the same.

34. §. From whence, we have a further proof of what I have formerly
asserted, which is, That in all _Plants_, there are _Two_ Substantially
different _Parts_, ♦ _B. 1. c. 7. §. 13. 14._ ♦ and no more than _Two_,
_viz._ the _Pithy_, and the _Towy_ or _Lignous Parts_.

35. §. From hence also we have some ground to conjecture, That so many
of the _Aer-Vessels_, at least, which are not formed with the seed, but
_post-nate_, are originated from the _Parenchymous Parts_; which seem
by some alteration in the _Quality_, _Position_ and _Texture_ of the
_Fibres_, to be Transformed into _Aer-Vessels_, as _Caterpillars_ are
into _Flies_. And as the _Pith_ it self, by the Rupture and Shrinking
up of several _Rows_ of _Bladders_, doth oftentimes become Tubulary:
So is it also probable, that in the other _Parenchymous Parts_, one
single _Row_ or _File_ of _Bladders_ evenly and perpendicularly piled;
may sometimes, by the shrinking up of their Horizontal _Fibres_, all
regularly break one into another and so make one _continued Cavity_;
or a _Tube_, whose _Diametre_ is the same with that of the _Bladders_,
wherof it is composed. All which, will appear more probable, and what
hath been said, be yet better understood, when we come, in the next
_Chapter_, to the Description of the _Pith_.




                                CHAP. IV.

                             _Of the PITH._

THE Third General _Part_ of a _Branch_ is the _Pith_. Which though it
have a different name from the _Parenchyma_ in the _Barque_, and the
_Insertions_ in the _Wood_; yet, as to its _Substance_, it is the very
same with them both. Whereof there is a double evidence, _sc._ their
_Continuity_, and the sameness of their _Texture_. Their _Texture_
shall be shewed presently. As to their _Continuity_, it is to be
noted, That as the _Skin_ is continuous with the _Parenchyma_ of the
_Barque_; and this _Parenchyma_ likewise, with the _Insertions_ in the
_Wood_; so these _Insertions_ again, running through the _Wood_, are
also continuous with the _Pith_. So that the _Skin_, _Parenchyma_,
_Insertions_, and _Pith_, are all _One entire piece of Work_; being
only filled up, in divers manners, with the _Vessels_.

2. §. The _Size_ of the _Pith_ is various, being not the same in any
two _Branches_ here represented. ♦ _Tab. 24, 31, 34, 35. 22, 29, 30, 32.
23, 25, 26, 35. 27. 28._ ♦ In _Wormwood_, _Sumach_, _Fig_, _Barbery_,
’tis very large; _sc._ betwixt 5, and 7 _Inches Diametre_, as it
appears through the _Microscope_. In _Pine_, _Ash_, _Holly_, _Walnut_,
not so large; from 3 _Inches Diameter_ to 4. In _Oak_, _Apple_, _Pear_,
_Hazel_, lesser, scarce from 2, to 3. In _Damascene_, not above an
_Inch_ and half. And in _Elm_, scarce an _Inch Diameter_. Note also,
that of all _Plants_, both _Herbs_, and _Shrubs_, have generally the
largest _Piths_, in proportion with the other _Parts_ of the same
_Branch_, as in _Sumach_, _Fig_, _Barbery_, is manifest.

3. §. It is also worth the noting, That wheras, in most _Plants_, the
_Barque_ and _Wood_ do both grow thicker every year: the _Pith_, on
the contrary, groweth more slender; So that in a _Branch_ of one years
growth, it is apparently more ample, than in one of two; and in a
_Branch_ of two, than in one of three; and so on.

4. §. The _Pith_, for the most part, if not always, in the _Branch_,
as well as the _Root_, is furnished with a certain number of
_Sap-Vessels_. They are here usually so postur’d, as to make a _Ring_
on the _Margin_ of the _Pith_. Where they are more numerous, or large,
they are more evident; as in _Walnut_, _Fig_, _Pine_, and others. They
are also of divers _Kinds_, ♦ _Tab. 30, 31, 32._ ♦ answerable to those
in the _Barque_; as in _Wallnut_, _Lymphæducts_; in _Fig_, _Lacteals_;
in _Pine_, _Resiniferous_.

5. §. The _Parenchyma_ of the _Pith_ is composed of _Bladders_. Which
are the very same with those in the _Barque_, and oftentimes in the
_Insertions_ within the _Wood_. Only these in the _Pith_, are of the
largest _Size_; those in the _Barque_, of a lesser; and those of the
_Insertions_ least of all: for which reason they are less obvious than
in the _Pith_.

6. §. The _Bladders_ of the _Pith_, though always comparatively Great;
yet are of very different _Sizes_. Being easily distinguished, even as
to their _Horizontal Area_, to _Twenty_ Degrees. ♦ _Tab. 24, 31._ ♦
Those of _Fig_, _Barberry_, and some others, are somewhat large. And
of many _Herbs_, as of _Thistle_, _Borage_, and others, ♦ _Tab. 39._
♦ three times as big again; appearing in the _Microscope_, like to
the largest _Cells_ of an _Hony-comb_. Those of _Plum_, _Worm-wood_,
_Sumach_, less. Of _Elm_, _Apple_, _Pear_, lesser. Of _Holly_ and
_Oak_, still less. ♦ _Tab. 32._ ♦ So that the _Bladders_ of the _Pith_
in _Borage_ or Common _Thistle_, are of that _Size_, as to contain,
within the compass only of their _Horizontal Area_, about twenty
_Bladders_ of the _Pith_ of _Oak_. Wherefore one whole _Bladder_ in
_Thistle_, is, at least an hundred times bigger, than another in _Oak_.

7. §. Of the _Size_ of these _Bladders_ of the _Pith_, ’tis also to
be noted, That it doth not at all follow the _Size_ of the _Pith_ it
self; but is still varied, according as Nature designeth the _Pith_ for
various use. Thus, whereas the _Pith_ of _Sumach_, is Larger than that
of _Barberry_; it might be thought, that the _Bladders_, whereof it is
composed, should be likewise Larger: Yet are they Three times as Small
again in _Sumach_, as they are in _Barberry_. ♦ _Tab. 24, 34. 26, 27.
23, 33._ ♦ So the _Pith_ of _Plum_, is far Less than that of _Pear_;
yet the _Bladders_ of the former are Four or Five times as big, as
those of the latter. So the _Pith_ of _Hazel_ is almost Three times as
Little again, as that of _Holly_; yet the _Bladders_ in _Hazel_, are
Ten times bigger, than in _Holly_.

8. §. The _Shape_ of the _Bladders_ hath also some Variety. For
although, for the most part, they are more round; yet oftentimes they
are angular: as in _Reed-grass_, a _Water-plant_; where they are
_Cubical_; and in _Borage_, _Thistle_, and many others, where they are
_pentangular_, _sexangular_ and _septangular_.

9. §. Of the _Texture_ of the _Bladders_, ’tis also to be noted, that
many times, the _Sides_ of the greater _Bladders_ are composed of
lesser; as is often seen in those of _Borage_, _Bulrush_, and some
other _Plants_. In the same manner, as the _Sap-Vessels_, are but
greater _Fibres_ made up of lesser.

10. §. The _Pith_, though always originally composed of _Bladders_,
and so _One Entire Piece_; yet in process, as the _Plant_ grows up,
it hath divers openings or _Ruptures_ made in it: oftentimes very
regularly, and always for good use, and with constancy observed in
the same _Species_ of _Plants_. In _Sharp-poynted Dock_, many of the
_Pores_ are considerably prolonged by the length, like small _Pipes_.
♦ _Tab. 19._ ♦ In _Walnut_ it shrinketh up into transverse _Filmes_
or _Membranes_; as likewise sometimes in _Spanish-Broom_. Sometimes
the _Pith_ is hollow or Tubulary: either throughout the _Trunk_, as in
_Thistle_, _Endive_, _Scorzonera_, _Marsh-Mallow_: or so, as to remain
entire at every joynt; as in _Sonchus_, _Nettle_, _Teasle_; in which it
is divided as it were into several _Stories_: and divers other ways.


11. §. I SHALL conclude this discourse with a further illustration of
the _Texture_ of the _Pith_, and of the whole _Plant_, as consequent
thereupon. I say therefore, (and have given some account hereof in
the _Anatomy_ of _Roots_) That as the _Vessels_ of a _Plant_, _sc._
the _Aer-Vessels_ and the _Lymphæducts_ are made up of _Fibres_;
according to what I have in this Discourse above said; so the _Pith_ of
a _Plant_, or the _Bladders_ whereof the _Pith_ consists are likewise
made up of _Fibres_. Which is true also of the _Parenchyma_ of the
_Barque_. And also of the _Insertions_ in the _Wood_. Yea, and of
the _Fruit_, and all other _Parenchymous Parts_ of a _Plant_. I say,
that the very _Pulp_ of an _Apple_, _Pear_, _Cucumber_, _Plum_, or
any other _Fruit_, is nothing else but a _Ball of most extream small
transparent Threds or Fibres, all wrapped and stitch’d up_ (though in
divers manners) _together_. And even all those _Parts_ of a _Plant_,
which are neither formed into visible _Tubes_, nor into _Bladders_, are
yet made up of _Fibers_. Which, though it be difficult to observe, in
any of those _Parts_ which are closer wrought and principally in the
_Insertions_ of some _Trees_: yet in the _Pith_, especially of some
_Plants_, which consisteth of more open _work_, they are more visible.
Which introduceth the observation of them in all other _Parenchymous
Parts_. So in the _Pith_ of a _Bulrush_ of the _Common Thistle_, ♦
_Tab. 38._ ♦ and some other _Plants_; not only the _Threds_ of which
the _Bladders_; but also the single _Fibres_, of which the _Threds_ are
composed; may sometimes with the help of a good _Glass_, be distinctly
seen. Yet one of these _Fibres_, may reasonably be computed to be a
Thousand times smaller than an _Horse-Hair_.

12. §. The _Fibrosity_ of the _Parenchyma_ is also visible in some
_Woods_, in which, it is apparently mixed with the _Lignous Parts_,
not only by _Insertions_, but _per minimas Partes organicas_. That
is to say, The _Parenchymous Fibres_, like smaller _Threds_, are
either _wraped round about_ both the _Lignous_ and the _Aer-Vessels_,
or at least _interwoven_ with them, and with every _Fiber_ of every
_Vessel_: as in very white _Ash_ or _Fir-Wood_, ♦ _Tab. 39._ ♦ with an
advantagious posture and light, may be observed.


13. §. WHENCE it follows, that the whole _Substance_, or all the
_Parts_ of a _Plant_, so far as _Organical_, they also consist of
_Fibres_. Of all which _Fibres_ those of the _Lymphæducts_, run only
by the _Length_ of the _Plant_: those of the _Pith_, _Insertions_, and
_Parenchyma_ of the _Barque_, run by the _breadth_ or horizontally:
those of the _Aer-Vessels_, fetch their Circuit by the _Breadth_, and
continue it by the _Length_.

14. §. By which means, the said _Parenchymous Fibres_, in fetching
their _horizontal Circles_, do thus _weave_, and make up the _Bladders_
of the _Pith_, in _Open-Work_. And the same _Fibres_ being thence
continued; they also _weave_ and make up the _Insertions_, but in
_Close-Work_. Betwixt which _Insertions_, the _Vessels_ being likewise
transversly interjected, some of the same _Fibres wrap_ themselves
also about these; thus _tying_ many of them together, and so making
those several _Conjugations_ and _Braces_ of the _Vessels_, which I
have formerly described. And as some of these _Horizontal Fibres_ are
_wraped_ about the _Vessels_; so also about the _Fibres_, whereof the
_Vessels_ are composed. By which means it is, that all the _Fibres_
of the _Vessels_ are _Tacked_ or _Stitched_ up close together into
One Coherent Piece. ♦ _Tab. 40._ ♦ Much after the same manner, as the
_Perpendicular Splinters_ or _Twigs_ of a _Basket_, are, by those that
run in and out _Horizontally_. And the same _Horizontal Fibres_, being
still further produced into the _Barque_; they there compose the same
_work_ over again (only not so _open_) as in the _Pith_.


15. §. SO THAT the most unfeigned and proper resemblance we can at
present, make of the whole _Body_ of a _Plant_, is, To a piece of
_fine Bone-Lace_, when the Women are working it upon the _Cushion_,
For the _Pith_, _Insertions_, and _Parenchyma_ of the _Barque_, are
all extream Fine and Perfect _Lace-Work_: the _Fibres_ of the _Pith_
running Horizontally, as do the _Threds_ in a Piece of _Lace_; and
bounding the several _Bladders_ of the _Pith_ and _Barque_, as the
_Threds_ do the several _Holes_ of the _Lace_; and making up the
_Insertions_ without _Bladders_, or with very small ones, as the same
_Threds_ likewise do the _close_ Parts of the _Lace_, which they call
the _Cloth-Work_. And lastly, both the _Lignous_ and _Aer-Vessels_,
stand all _Perpendicular_, and so cross to the _Horizontal Fibres_ of
all the said _Parenchymous Parts_; even as in a Piece of _Lace_ upon
the _Cushion_, the _Pins_ do to the _Threds_. The _Pins_ being also
conceived to be _Tubular_, and prolonged to any length; and the same
_Lace-Work_ to be wrought many Thousands of times over and over again,
to any thickness or hight, according to the hight of any _Plant_. And
this is the true _Texture_ of a _Plant_: and the _general composure_,
not only of a _Branch_, but of all other _Parts_ from the _Seed_ to the
Seed.




                            An Account of the

                               VEGETATION

                                   OF

                                 TRUNKS

                       Grounded upon the foregoing

                                ANATOMY.




                                PART II.

HAVING before given the _Anatomy_ of _Trunks_; I shall next proceed to
see, what _Use_ may be made thereof; and principally, to explicate the
manner of their _Vegetation_. In doing which, that former _Method_,
which I used in shewing the manner of the _Growth_ of _Roots_, I shall
not exactly follow. For so, in regard the _Organical Parts_ of the
_Root_ and _Trunk_ are the same, and consequently their _Nutrition_ and
_Conformation_ are effected in the same way; I should hereby be obliged
to a nauseous and unprofitable repetition of many things already said.
The _Explication_ therefore of all those _Particulars_, which more
especially belong to the _Trunk_, or are more Apparent therein, and not
spoken of, or not so fully, in the former _Books_, will be my present
Task. The chief _Heads_ whereof, shall be these Seven following, _viz._

FIRST, the _Motion_ and _Course_ of the _Sap_.

SECONDLY, The _Motion_ and _Course_ of the _Aer_.

THIRDLY, The _Structure_ of the _Parts_.

FOURTHLY, The _Generation_ of _Liquors_.

FIFTHLY, The _Figuration_ of _Trunks_.

SIXTHLY, The _Motion_ of _Trunks_.

SEVENTHLY, And lastly the _Nature_ of _Trunks_ as variously fitted for
_Mechanical Use_.




                                CHAP. I.

               _Of the_ Motion _and_ Course _of the_ Sap.


FIRST, as to the _Course_ of the _Sap_, there are Three _Parts_ in
which it _moveth_; _sc._ the _Pith_, the _Wood_ and the _Barque_. First
the _Pith_; in which the _Sap_ moveth the _First year_, and _only
the First year_. Or, it is _Proprium quarto modo_, to the _Pith_ of
every _Annual Growth_, and to the _Pith_ of such a _Growth_ only, _To
be succulent_. That is, whether of a _Sprout_ from a _Seed_, or of a
_Sucker_ from a _Root_, or of a _Cyon_ from a _Branch_; The _Pith_ is
always found the _First year_ full of _Sap_. But the _Second year_, the
same individual _Pith_, always becomes _dry_, and so it continues ever
after.

2. §. One cause whereof is, that the _Lymphæducts_ in the _Barque_,
being the first year adjacent to the _Pith_; they do all that
time, transfuse part of their _Sap_ into it, and so keep it always
_Succulent_. But the same _Lymphæducts_, the year following, are turned
into _Wood_; and the _Vessels_ which are then generated, and carry the
_Sap_, stand beyond them, in the _Barque_. So that the _Sap_ being now
more remote from the _Pith_, and intercepted by the new _Wood_, it
cannot be transfused, with that sufficient force and plenty as before,
into the _Pith_; which therefore, from the first year, always continues
dry.


3. §. THE SECOND _Part_ in which the _Sap moves_, _sub forma liquoris_,
is the _Wood_. Which yet, it doth not in all _Plants_, but only in
some; and visibly, in very few; as in the _Vine_: In a _Vine_, I say,
the _Sap_ doth _visibly ascend_ by the _Wood_. And this it doth, not
only the first year, but every year, so long as the _Vine_ continues to
grow. But although this _ascent_, in or through the _Wood_, be every
year; yet it is only in the _Spring_, for about the space of a Month;
_sc._ in _March_ and _April_.

4. §. There are many other _Trees_, besides the _Vine_, wherein,
about the same time of the year, the _Sap ascendeth_, though not so
copiously, yet chiefly, in the _Wood_. For if we take a _Branch_ of two
or three years growth, suppose of _Sallow_, and having first cut the
same transversely; if the _Barque_ be then also transversely, and with
some force, pressed with the back of the knife, near the newly cut end;
the _Sap_ will very plainly rise up out of the utmost _Ring_ of _Wood_.
And if it be pressed in the same manner, or a little more strongly,
about an Inch lower, the _Sap_ will ascend out of every _Ring_ of
_Wood_ to the Center. Yet at the same time, which is to be noted, there
_ariseth_ no _Sap_ at all out of the _Barque_.

5. §. Whence appears the Error of that so Common Opinion, That _the Sap
always riseth betwixt the Wood and the Barque_. The contrary whereunto
is most true, That it never doth. For the greater part of the year, it
riseth in the _Barque_, _sc._ in the inner _Margin_ adjacent to the
_Wood_, and in _Spring_, in or through the _Wood_ it self, and there
only.


6. §. THE THIRD _Part_ in which the _Sap_ ascends, is the _Barque_,
as was above hinted, and may be observ’d in almost any _Branch_, if
cut cross, in the _late Spring_ and in _Summer_; either as the _Sap_
issueth spontaneously, or upon pressing, as aforesaid. So that when the
_Sap_ ceaseth to ascend, _sub forma liquoris_, by the _Wood_, then it
begins to ascend by the _Barque_.

7. §. Besides the difference of _Time_, the _Organical Parts_ likewise,
in which these two _Saps_ ascend, are divers. For in the _Barque_, it
ascendeth _visibly_, only in the _Succiferous_, whereas in the _Wood_,
it ascendeth only by the _Aer-Vessels_.


8. §. FROM what hath been said, we may understand, what is meant by
the _Bleeding_ of _Plants_. If we take it generally, it properly
enough expresses, _The eruption of the Sap out of any Vessels_. And
so, almost all _Plants_, in _Summer_ time, do _Bleed_, that is, from
_Sap-Vessels_, either in the _Barque_, or in the _Margin_ of the
_Pith_: the _Saps_ they _Bleed_, having either a _Sower_, _Sweet_,
_Hot_, _Bitter_, or other _Tast_. At which time, the _Vessels_ also, in
the _Barque_ of a _Vine-Branch_, do _Bleed_ a _Sower Sap_.

9. §. But that which is _vulgarly_ called _Bleeding_, as in a _Vine_,
is quite another thing; both as to the _Liquor_ which issueth, and the
_Place_ where it issues: that is to say, it is neither a _Sweet_, nor
_Sower_, but _Tasteless Sap_; issuing, not from any _Vessels_ in the
_Barque_, but from the _Aer-Vessels_ in the _Wood_. So that there is
as much difference betwixt _Bleeding_ in a _Vine_, or the _Rising_ of
the _Sap_ in any other _Tree_, in _March_, and in _July_; as there is
betwixt _Salivation_ and an _Hæmorrhage_; or betwixt the _Course_ of
the _Chyle_ in the _Lactiferous Vessels_, and the _Circulation_ of the
_Blood_ in the _Arteries_ and _Veins_.


10. §. NOW the Cause from whence it comes to pass, that the _early
Spring-Sap_ of a _Vine_, and other _Trees_, ascendeth by the _Wood_,
is, In that the _Generation_ of the young _Sap-Vessels_ in the
_Barque_, by which the _Sap_ ascendeth all the _Summer_; is, in the
beginning of _Spring_, but newly attempted. So that the _Sap_ having
not yet these _Vessels_ to receive it, it therefore (_pro hac vice_)
runs up the _Aer-Vessels_ in the _Wood_. But so soon as the said
_Vessels_ in the _Barque_ begin to be considerably encreased, the
_Sap_, declining the _Aer-Vessels_, betakes it self to _These_, as its
most proper _Receptacles_.


11. §. THE CAUSE also, why the _Vessels_ of almost all _Plants_, upon
cutting, do yield _Sap_, or _Bleed_; is the _Pressure_ which the
_Parenchyma_ makes upon them. For the _Pith_ and other _Parenchymous
Parts_ of a _Plant_, upon the reception of _Liquor_, have always a
_Conatus_ to _dilate_ themselves. As is manifest from _Sponges_, which
are a Substance of the same Nature, and have a somewhat like structure.
As also from _Cork_, which is but the _Parenchyma_ or _Barque_ of a
_Tree_. I say therefore, that the _Parenchyma_ being fill’d and swell’d
with _Sap_, hath thereby a continual _Conatus_ to _dilate_ it self;
and in the same degree, to press together or contract the _Vessels_
which it surroundeth. And the said _Vessels_ being cut, their actual
_Contraction_ and the _Eruption_ of the _Sap_, do both immediately
follow.


12. §. IT may be also noted, That the _Trunk_ or _Branch_ of any
_Plant_ being cut, it always _bleeds_ at both ends, or upwards and
downwards, alike freely. Which, as well as divers other _Experiments_
plainly shews, That in the _Sap-Vessels_ of a _Plant_, there are no
_Valves_.


13. §. FROM what we have now above, and elsewhere formerly said, we may
also understand the _manner_ of the _Ascent_ of the _Sap_. As to which,
I say, _First_, That considering to what height and plenty, the _Sap_
sometimes ascends; it is not intelligible, how it should thus ascend,
by virtue of any one _Part_ of a _Plant_, alone; that is neither by
virtue of the _Parenchyma_, nor by virtue of the _Vessels_, alone.
Not by the _Parenchyma_ alone. For this, as it hath the Nature of a
_Sponge_ or _Filtre_, to suck up the _Sap_; so likewise, to suck it up
but to a certain height, as perhaps, about an Inch, or two, and no more.

14. §. Nor by the _Vessels_ alone, for the same reason. For although we
see, that small _Glass-Pipes_ immersed in Water, will give it an ascent
for some Inches; yet there is a certain _period_, according to the
_bore_ of the _Pipe_, beyond which it will not rise. We must therefore
joyn the _Vessels_ and the _Parenchyma_ both together in this Service;
which we may conceive performed by them in the manner following.

15. §. Let A B be the _Vessel_ of a _Plant_. Let C E D F be the
_Bladders_ of the _Parenchyma_, wherewith, as with so many little
_Cisterns_, it is surrounded. ♦ _Tab. 39._ ♦ I say then, that the
_Sap_, in the _Pipe_ B A, would, of it self, rise but a few Inches;
as suppose, from D to L. But the _Bladders_ D P, which surround it,
being swelled up and turgid with _Sap_, do hereby press upon it; and
so not only a little contract its bore, but also transfuse or strain
some _Portion_ of their _Sap_ thereinto: by both which means, the
_Sap_ will be forced to rise higher therein. And the said _Pipe_ or
_Vessel_ being all along surrounded by the like _Bladders_; the _Sap_
therein, is still forced higher and higher: the _Bladders_ of the
_Parenchyma_ being, as is said, so many _Cisterns_ of _Liquor_, which
transfuse their repeated Supplies throughout the length of the _Pipe_.
So that by the supply and pressure of the _Cisterns_ or _Bladders_ F
D, the _Sap_ riseth to L; by the _Bladders_ Q L, it rises to M; by the
_Bladders_ N M, it rises to I; by the _Bladders_ O I, it rises to K; by
the _Bladders_ P K, it rises to E; and so to the top of the _Tree_. And
thus far of the _Motion_ of the _Sap_.




                                CHAP. II.

               _Of the_ Motion _and_ Course _of the_ Aer.


THE NEXT enquiry to be made, is, into the _Motion_ and _Course_ of the
_Aer_. Where this question will first of all be asked; _sc._ Which
way the _Aer_ first _enters_ the _Plant_; whether at the _Trunk_,
_Leaves_, and other _Parts_ above ground; or at the _Root_? _I_ answer,
_That it enters in part, at them all_. For the _Reception_, as well as
_Extramission_ whereof, the _Pores_ are so very large, in the _Trunks_
of some _Plants_, as in the better sort of thick walking _Canes_, that
they are visible, to a good Eye, without a _Glass_; ♦ _Tab. 19._ ♦ but
with a _Glass_, the _Cane_ seems, as if it were stuck top full of holes
with great _Pins_: being so large, as very well to resemble the _Pores_
of the _Skin_ in the end of the _Fingers_ and _Ball_ of the _Hand_.

2. §. In the _Leaves_ of _Pine_, they are likewise through a _Glass_,
a very Elegant Show; standing all most exactly, in _rank_ and _file_,
throughout the length of the _Leaves_. The _Figure_ whereof shall be
given hereafter, when we come to the _Anatomy_ of the _Leaf_.

3. §. But although the _Aer_ enters, in part, at the _Trunk_ and other
_Parts_, especially in some _Plants_; yet its _chief_ entrance, is at
the _Root_. Even as some Parts of _Aer_, may continually pass into the
_Body_ and _Blood_, by the _Habit_, or _Pores_ of the _Skin_; but the
chief entrance hereof, is at the _Mouth_. And what the _Mouth_ is, to
an _Animal_; that the _Root_ is to a _Plant_.

4. §. Again, if the chief entrance of the _Aer_, were at the _Trunk_;
then, before it could be mixed with the _Sap_ in the _Root_, it must
descend; and so move not only contrary to its own Nature, but likewise
in a contrary Course to the _Sap_, throughout the _Plant_. Whereas, by
its _Reception_ at the _Root_, and so its _Transition_ from thence; it
hath a more natural and easie motion of Ascent. For while the _Sap_
ascends, that the _Aer_, in the same _Plant_, should continually
descend, cannot reasonably be supposed.

5. §. The same is further argued, From the fewness and smallness of
the _Diametral Portions_ in the _Trunk_ in comparison with those in
the _Root_. In which _Nature_ hath plainly designed the same, for the
_Separation_ of the _Aer_ from the _Sap_, after they are both together
received thereinto. So that the _Reception_ and _Course_ of the _Aer_,
is made on this manner following.


6. §. THE _Aer_ being a _Springy_ Body, it insinuates into all the
_Holes_ and _Cranies_ of the _Earth_; and so is plentifully mixed
therewith. Whereupon, as the _Sap_ enters the _Root_, more or less
_Aer_ still intrudes it self together with it. The _Liquid_ Portion of
the _Sap_, swells and fills up the _Succulent Parts_ of the _Barque_.
The _Aery_ Part, is, as was said, separated from the _Liquid_, into
the _Diametral_ Portions. Which running from the _Barque_ towards the
Centre of the _Root_, and so passing along betwixt the _Aer-Vessels_;
do hereby convey the _Aery_ Part of the _Sap_ from the _Barque_, into
the same.

7. §. Being thus received into the _Aer-Vessels_, and the _Reception_
thereof, by the same means continued; it is by them advanced into
the _Trunk_. In which advance, it is again, more or less, disbursed
into all the _Parts_ of the _Trunk_, as it goes. _Partly_, inwards
to the _Pith_. From whence, the _Pith_ is always, at length, filled
with _Aer_. _Partly_, into the _Insertions_; by which it is conveyed
outward into the _Barque_. Wherein, it is in some part, transfused
through the _Sap_: and so the rest, with part of the _Sap_, remitted,
in _perspirations_, back again into the _Aer_.

8. §. So that, whereas the _Diametral Portions_ in the _Root_, do
serve to convey the _Aer_ from the _Sap_ in the _Barque_, into the
_Aer-Vessels_, in the _Wood_: on the contrary, the _Insertions_ here in
the _Trunk_, serve to convey the _Aer_ from the _Aer-Vessels_ in the
_Wood_, into the _Sap_, in the _Barque_. Wherefore, as the _Aer-Vessels
advance_ the _Aer_, or the _Aery Part_ of the _Sap_, and so convey it
by the _length_ of the _Trunk_; so the _Insertions filter_ it, and
convey it by the _breadth_.


9. §. AND that the _Insertions_ have this _Office_ or _Subservience_
unto both _Kinds_ of _Vessels_; doth yet further appear, if we
consider, That the _Aer-Vessels_ are always so postured, as to touch
upon the said _Insertions_, or at least to stand very near them. For
either they are large, and so do frequently touch upon them on both
sides; as in _Elm_, _Ash_, _Wallnut_, &c. ♦ _Tab. 28. 29. 22._ ♦ Or if
they are small; then they either run along in even lines collateral
and oftentimes contiguous with the said _Insertions_, as in _Holly_:
or at least, are reciprocally, some on one side, and some on another,
inclined to them; as in _Apple_. ♦ 25. ♦ By all which means, the _Aer_
is more readily conveyed from the _Vessels_ into the _Insertions_.

10. §. A further evidence hereof is this, That generally, the bigger
and the more numerous the _Aer-Vessels_ be; the bigger, or at least,
the more numerous also are the _Insertions_: Especially, if the
comparison be made (as in all other cases it ought to be, as well as
here) betwixt the several _Species_ of the same _Kind_. So _Corin_,
which hath small _Aer-Vessels_, ♦ _Tab. 17._ ♦ hath also very small
_Insertions_. But the _Vine_, hath both very large: and so for others.

11. §. Wherefore, the _Insertions_ minister betwixt the _Aer-Vessels_,
and the _Succiferous_; in the same manner, as the _Vesiculæ_ of the
_Lungs_, do betwixt the _Bronchiæ_ and the _Arteries_. That is to
say, as in an _Animal_, the _Bronchiæ_ deposite the _Aer_ into the
_Vesiculæ_ of the _Lungs_; which administer it to the _Arteries_: so in
a _Plant_, the _Aer-Vessels_ deposit the _Aer_ into the _Insertions_,
that is into the _Vesiculæ_ of the _Insertions_; by which it is
gradually _filtred_ off into the _Barque_ and the _Sap-Vessels_ therein.




                               CHAP. III.

                   _Of the_ Structure _of the_ Parts.


A THIRD enquiry, is into the _Generation_ and _Structure_ of _Parts_.
The manner whereof I have already endeavoured to _explicate_[61] from
the _Anatomy_ of the _Root_, throughout all particulars. Some whereof I
shall yet further clear.

     [61] _Lib. 2. P. 2._

1. §. As _First_, the _Union_ of the _Barque_ to the _Body_ of the
_Tree_, Contrary to the common Opinion, _That they are not continuous_;
but that the _Barque_ only surrounds the _Body_, as a _Scabbard_ does a
_Sword_, or a _Glove_ the _Hand_. As also seemeth to be proved, by the
easy _Slipping_ of the _Barque_ of _Willow_, and most other _Trees_,
when full of _Sap_, from the _Wood_.

2. §. But, notwithstanding this, they are as truly continuous, as
the _Skin_ of the _Body_ is with the _Flesh_: _sc._ by means of the
_Parenchyma_; which is one entire _Body_, running from the _Barque_
into the _Wood_, and so uniting both together; ♦ _Tab. 19._ ♦ as in a
_Branch_ of _Vine_ or _Corin-Tree_, when the _Barque_ is stripped off,
is apparent; the Spaces between the several _Parts_ of the _Wood_,
being filled up with the _Parenchymous_, inserted from the _Barque_.

3. §. Now the reason why the _Barque_ nevertheless slips so easily
from the _Wood_, is plain, _viz._ Because most of the young _Vessels_
and _Parenchymous Parts_, are there every year successively formed;
that is, betwixt the _Wood_ and _Barque_: where the said _Parts_ newly
formed, are as tender, as the tenderest _Vessels_ in _Animals_. And
we may imagine, how easie it were at once to tear or break a thousand
_Vessels_ or _Fibres_ of an _Embrio_, of a _Womb_ or _Egg_.


4. §. THE same _Vessels_ of the _Barque_ being always _braced_, and
gradually falling off, together with the _Parenchyma_, into the
utmost _Rind_: Hence it is, that the _Barques_ of many _Trees_, are
as it were, ♦ _Tab. 19._ ♦ latticed with several _Cracks_ of divers
_Sizes_, and sometimes in the _Figure_ of _Rombs_: the said _Fissures_
representing the _Position_ and _Tract_ of the _Vessels_ in their
_Braces_. Hence also it is, that the _Barque_ of some _Trees_, as
of _Corin_, _Cherry_, &c. falleth off in _Rings_, _sc._ because the
_Sap-Vessels_ are posited in the same manner in the _Barque_.

5. §. The _Sap-Vessels_, as they are generated at the inner _Verge_ of
the _Barque_: so likewise, in a small quantity, at the utmost _Verge_
of the _Pith_. These being not only fed with a more vigorous _Sap_, but
with great caution, secured within the _Wood_, for the propagation of
the succeeding _Buds_.

6. §. Hence also it is, that is, by the annual accretion of these
_Vessels_, that the _Pith_ is sometimes less in the _Trunk_, than in
the _Branches_; ♦ _Tab. 18._ ♦ and less in the elder _Branches_, than
in the younger; and sometimes ’tis almost wholly filled up. By which
means, as the _Branches_ carry every year a greater burthen; so they
become still more sturdy the better to support it.


7. §. SOMETIMES also the _Pith_ breaks and shrinks up, thus making
the _Trunk_ a _Pipe_. The cause whereof, is either the _Largeness_ of
its _Pores_, or the _Thinness_ of the _Sides_ of the said _Pores_;
upon both which accounts, the _Pith_ doth more easily tear, and upon
tearing shrink up, and so become hollow: as in _Cichory_, _Lampsana_,
_Sonchus_, _Teasel_, _Brownwort_, and others; wherein the _Pores_
of the _Pith_ are _Large_, and the _Sides_ of the _Pores_, _Thin_.
Whereas, upon contrary accounts, the _Piths_ of most _Trees_, remain
perpetually entire.


8. §. THE Reason why _Plants_ are made thus to become _hollow_, is
_partly_, for the _ripening_ of the _Fruit_ or _Seed_; which is the
better effected by a more plentiful supply of _Aer_ continually
received into their hollow _Trunks_. For by means of that _Aer_, part
of the _Sap_, is dryed up, and the remaining part of it made warmer,
and so sooner matured.

9. §. _Partly_, for the better determining the due _Age_ of the
_Plant_. Hence it is, that the greater part of _Annual Trunks_, are
hollow: the _Aer_ contained in that hollow, drying up the _Sap_, and
shrinking up the _Sap-Vessels_ so far, as to hinder the free motion of
the _Sap_ therein; from whence the _Plant_ must needs perish. So that
as the _Content_ of the _Aer-Vessels_, is a kind of _Vegetable Aer_,
whose Office is to _Attenuate_, and _Ferment_ the _Juyces_ of _Plants_:
so the _Content_ of these _Cavities_, cometh nearer to a more common
_Aer_, designed chiefly, so soon as it is convenient, to _dry_ them up.


10. §. AGAIN, as to the _Aer-Vessels_, divers questions may be asked.
As how it comes to pass, that they are generally less in the _Trunk_
of the same _Plant_, than in the _Root_? The Cause whereof is, that
here in the _Trunk_ they are more under the power of the _Aer_; both
that which entreth in at the _Trunk_, and that which of its own
_Nature_ ascendeth up into it from the _Root_. For the _Aer_, as we
have elsewhere said, is the _Mould_ of the _Aer-Vessels_; to whose
crooked or at least, _Acid Parts_, the _Saline_, and other _Principles_
concurring to their generation, do conform. To which they do best,
the smaller they are: the _Fibres_ of the larger _Aer-Vessels_ making
greater _Circles_, and so coming nearer to a _right Line_, answerable
to the _Figure_ of the Particles, not of the _Aerial_, but of the
_Saline Principle_.

11. §. Wherefore as the _Aer-Vessels_ may be observed still to be
dilated or widened towards the lower parts of the _Root_, the _Aerial
Principle_ being there less predominant, and the _Saline_ more: So
towards the upper part of the _Trunk_, to be contracted or grow
smaller; the _Aerial Principle_ being here more predominant, and the
_Saline_ less.


12. §. FOR the same cause it may be observed, That the _Aer-Vessels_ of
the Second years Growth, and the several years succeeding, are usually
nearer of one Size, than those of the _Second_ and _First_; all being
under a less power of the _Aer_, than the _First_. For the first year
the _Pith_ being full of _Liquor_, the _Aer-Vessels_ themselves, are
the only _Repositories_ of the _Aer_. Whereas after the first year, the
_Pith_ becoming dry, or another great _Repository_ for the _Aer_; the
_Aer-Vessels_ are henceforth filled with a moister or more _Vaporous_
and _Saline Aer_, and so made to grow wider.

13. §. Hence the very _Size_ of the _Pith_, hath much _influence_ upon
the _Aer-Vessels_, and the manner of _Nutrition_, and the _Generation_
of _Liquors_ in _Plants_.


14. §. BUT for the most part, the _Aer-Vessels_ are somewhat, more or
less, amplified in every new _Annual Ring_; or at least to a certain
number of years. Probably, because in the elder _Branches_, the _Spiral
Fibres_, of which the _Vessels_ consist, are more bulky; and so make
a _Vessel_ of a wider, as a more agreeable bore. Nature obtaining
hereby, that the Quantity of _Aer_, shall always be answerable to the
Growth of the _Plant_, or at least, be sufficient to maintain its
_Vegetable Life_ and _Vigour_.

15. §. And therefore, as is above hinted, it seems likely, That after a
certain number of years, the _Aer-Vessels_ are no longer amplified, but
stand at a stay, and perhaps may grow smaller, according as the _Tree_
is less or more _Longæve_; and that after this period, it is some way
or other in its Declining State.


16. §. LASTLY, from the _Content_ and _Governing Principle_ of the
_Aer-Vessels_, the _Time_, when they begin every year to be formed, or
to appear, is always _later_; at least with respect to the _season_ of
the _Tree_. So that whereas the _Sap-Vessels_ begin to be formed in
_Spring_: these, not till the latter end of _Summer_, or there about;
at least not till about that time to _appear_. That is, when the _Sap_
begins to decrease, and to grow more _Aery_; and so more fit matter for
the _Generation_ of the said _Aer-Vessels_.




                                CHAP. IV.

                    _Of the_ Generation _of_ Liquors.


UPON the _Structure_ and _Formation_ of the _Parts_, dependeth the
_Generation_ of _Liquors_, as was lately intimated. The _manner_
whereof I have formerly shewed, in discoursing of the _Root_. Yet some
things I shall here further _explicate_. And _First_, what we have
formerly asserted, _sc._ That the concurrence of two _specifically_
distinct _Fluids_, is as necessary to _Nutrition_ in _Plants_, as in
_Animals_. Which appears, as from divers other considerations, so from
the very _Structure_ of a _Plant_: where in all the _Organical Parts_,
or the _Parenchyma_ and the _Vessels_, are every where mixed together
_per minima_, that is, _per minimas partes organicas_, or _Fiber_ with
_Fiber_ of several _Kinds_. Every small part of a _Tree_, or of the
_Barque_ of a _Tree_, being as I may say, a sort of _Linsy-Woolsey_. So
that there is not the least part of the _Sap_, which is not impregnate
with divers _Essential Tinctures_, as it is continually _filtred_ from
the _Fibres_ of _one Kind_, to those of another; standing every where
_woun’d_ and _stitch’d_ up together for the same purpose.


2. §. FROM the special _Nature_ and _Structure_ of the _Parts_, the
_Liquors_ of _Plants_ are likewise _specified_. The _Vessels_ being
the chief _Viscera_ of a _Plant_. For all _Liquors_ in a _Plant_,
are certainly made by that _Plant_. And since the _Plant_ hath no
_Viscera_ (so called) I would then know, what its several _Liquors_
are made by? If in the _Parenchyma_, surely by that _Parenchyma_. If
in the _Vessels_, by the _Vessels_. And if of divers _Kinds_ by divers
_Kinds_ of _Vessels_. So that what the _Viscera_ are in _Animals_, the
_Vessels_ themselves are in _Plants_. That is to say, as the _Viscera_
of an _Animal_, are but _Vessels conglomerated_: so the _Vessels_ of a
_Plant_, are _Viscera drawn out at length_.


3. §. AGAIN, as the _specifying_ of the _Sap_ dependeth chiefly on
the special _Nature_ of the _Parts_: so partly, upon the _Structure_
of the _Whole_. Whereby every _Part_ is still better accomodated with
its own _Juyce_. Thus the _Aer-Vessels_ are necessary, not only and
barely for a _supply_ of _Aer_; but also by their _Number_, _Size_, and
_Position_ to _adjust_ the quantity of that _Aer_, to the government of
_Nutrition_, and the _Generation_ of the _Specifick Liquors_ of every
_Plant_. Which is evident from hence, in that they do not follow the
_Size_ of the _Plant_; but are great and many, in some small _Plants_;
and small and few, in some others that are large. So _Vines_, and
_Corn_, as we have formerly observed, have proportionably a great
number of _Aer-Vessels_, and those very large. By which means the _Sap_
is _attenuated_ and less _Oyly_, and more copiously impregnated with a
_Subtle_, _Volatile_ and _Winy Spirit_.

4. §. For the same reason, the _Stalk_ of _Maze_ or of _Indian
Wheat_, which when it is _Green_ yieldeth a very sweet _Juyce_; and
the _Canes_, whereof _Sugar_ (which aboundeth with a _volatile_ and
_inflammable Spirit_) is made; these, I say, obtain the like over
proportion of _Aer-Vessels_, to what we see in most other _Plants_.
Hence also it is, that none of the said _Plants_ have any considerable
_Barque_; that so the attenuating and subtilizing _Aer_, may have a
more easie and plentiful admission at the _Trunk_ also. For which
reason likewise the _Pores_ of the _Skin_ of some _Canes_ are, as hath
been said, remarkably wide.

5. §. Hence also it is observable, that of the same _Species_ or
_Kindred_, those _Plants_ which have the most, and especially the
largest _Aer-Vessels_; have also the greatest abundance either of a
_sweet_, or of a _winy Liquor_. So in _Apple_; they are larger than
in _Crab_; In _Warden_, larger than in _Quince_; and in _Pear-Tree_,
larger than in _Warden_. So also in _Corin_, larger than in
_Gooseberry_; and in _Vine_, larger than in _Corin:_ and so in others.


6. §. AND as the _Aer-Vessels_, by their _Multitude_ and _Largeness_,
are accommodated to the better making of a _Winy Sap_: so by their
_fewness_ and _smallness_, of an _Oylie_. As is remarkably seen in
_Fir_, and other _Resiniferous Trees_: these having, if not the
_smallest_, yet the _fewest Aer-Vessels_ of all other _Trees_.


7. §. IF it be asked, how a _Plant_ comes to have any _Oyl_ at all
in any _Part_? Since we see, that the _Sap_ by which the _Root_ is
fed, seemeth to be nothing else but _Water_: and that many _Plants_
which yield a great deal of _stillatitious Oyl_, as _Mint_, _Rue_,
and others, will yet grow in _Water_: I say, if it be enquired how
this _Water_, is made _Wine_ or _Oyl_? I answer, that there is no
such matter. But that the _Oyl_, and all other _Vegetable Principles_
are actually existent in, and mixed _per minima_, though in an
extraordinary small proportion, with the _Water_. Even as we see the
distilled _Waters_ of _Anise Seeds_, _Penyroyal_, and the like to be
impregnated with their own _Oyls_, which give the _Taste_ and _Smell_
to such _Waters_.

8. §. Wherefore, as a certain quantity of any _Salt_ may be dissolved
in _Water_; beyond which, it will not mix therewith, but remains under
its own _Form_: So is there a certain proportion of _Oyl_, though far
less, which may also be perfectly mixed with _Water_; and is certainly
so, more or less, with all the _Water_ in the world. But if that
proportion, or degree of impregnation be once exceeded; the particles
of _Oyl_ do then, and not till then, gather into a body, and appear
under their own _Form_.

9. §. I say therefore, that all kinds of _Vegetable Principles_, are
either in or together with the _Water_, with less difference first
received into a _Plant_. But when they are once therein; they are then
_separated_, that is to say, _filtred_, some from others, in very
different _Proportions_ and _Conjunctions_ by the several _Parts_;
the _Watery_ by one _Part_, the _Aery_ by another, the _Oyly_ by
another, and so the rest: and so every _Part_ is the _Receptacle_ of a
_Liquor_, become peculiar, not by any _Transformation_, but only the
_Percolation_ of _Parts_ out of the _common Mass_ or _Stock_ of _Sap_.
And so all those parts of the _Sap_, which are _superflous_ to any kind
of _Plant_, are at the same time, discharged back by _Perspirations_,
into the _Aer_.


10. §. AND, that _Nature_, in the various _Percolations_ and
_Sepations_ of the _Sap_, may still the better answer her end; hence,
it is, that she carefully seeth, not only to the special _Nature_ and
_Proportion_ of the _Organs_, by which she doth her work; but likewise
to their very _Position_. Thus it is observable, That whereas the
_Lymphæducts_, which carry a more _Watery Liquor_, are still placed
on the inner _Verge_ of the _Barque_, next to the _Aer-Vessels_: the
_Lactiferous_ and _Resiniferous Vessels_ of _Plants_, to whose _Oylie
Liquor_ a mixture of much _Aer_ is incongruous; do usually stand,
neither on the inner, nor the outer verge of the _Barque_; but in the
_midle_. By which means, they are at the greatest distance, and so most
secure, from the _Aer_; either that which enters the _Barque_ at the
Circumference, or from the _Wood_ and _Pith_.


11. §. AND because the _Resinous Liquors_ of _Plants_ are more _Oily_,
than their _Milky_; their security therefore, from the approach of the
_Aer_, is yet further contrived. In that in _Pine_, and other _Resinous
Trees_, the _Diametral Insertions_ are never found; or at least,
not _visible_: which yet in other _Trees_, are _conspicuous_; being
those _Parts_, whose office it is, to introduce the _Aer_ from the
_Aer-Vessels_ into the _Barque_.


12. §. AGAIN, the _Milky Liquors_ of _Plants_ being thinner than the
_Resinous_, and having a considerable quantity of _Water_ mixed with
their _Oyl_; hence it is, that in _Milky Plants_, as in _Rhus_, there
are a greater number of _Lymphæducts_; and those standing nearer to
the _Milky Vessels_, than they do in _Pine_ and the like, to the
_Resinous_. By which means they are better fitted to affuse their
_Aqueous Parts_ more plentifully to the said _Milky Liquor_.


13. §. FROM the _Mixture_ of _Watery Parts_ with the _Oylie_, it comes
to pass, that whereas all _Lympha’s_, _Mucilages_, and _Rosins_ are
transparent; the _Aquæ-oleous Liquors_ of _Plants_ are _Milky_ or
white, or otherwise _Opacous_. For the same thing is the cause of the
whiteness of _Vegetable_, as of _Animal-Milk_: that is to say, a more
copious mixture of _Watery_ and _Oily Parts per minima_, or into one
Body. For even the _Serous_ and _Oylie Parts_ of _Animal Milk_, when
throughly separated one from the other, they become very transparent.
So the _Stillatitious Oyl_ of _Anise Seeds_, is most transparent and
_limpid_, even as _Water_ it self: yet there is a known sort of _White
Anise-Seed Water_, as it is commonly called: that it is to say, wherein
the _Oyl_, in distillation, ariseth and is mixed more plentifully with
the _Water_. And the _Water_, wherein the stillatitious _Oyl_ of any
_Vegetable_ is dissolved, becomes a perfect white _Milk_; as in this
_Honourable and Learned Presence_, I have formerly had occasion to shew
the Experiment.[62]

     [62] See the _Discourse_ of _Mixture_


14. §. AND that the _Milky Liquors_ of all _Vegetables_ whatsoever,
are more _Oylie_ than their _Lympha’s_, is most certain. For all those
_Gums_, which dissolve either in _Oyl_ or in _Water_, as _Galbanum_,
and the like, are originally the _Milky Juyces_ of _Plants_. And if you
take the _Milk_ of any _Plant_, as for instance, the _Milk_ of common
_Sumach_, or of any _Taste_, _Bitter_, _Astringent_, _Hot_, _Cold_, or
any other whatsoever; and having well _dryed_ it, and then fired it at
a candle; it will thereupon burn with a very bright and durable flame,
even like that of _Tar_ or _Turpentine_ it self.


15. §. FROM what hath been said, we may likewise gather the most
genuine import of the word _Gum_, and the distinction thereof both
from a _Rosin_ and a _Mucilage_. First, a _Rosin_, is originally
a _Turpentine_, or _Acidoleous Liquor_, having an exceeding small
quantity of _Watery Parts_ mixed therewith; and which, for that reason,
will not be dissolved in _Water_, but only in _Oyl_. Of this kind are
_Mastick_, _Benzoine_, _Taccamahacca_, and divers others, commonly, in
our _Bils_ to _Apothecaries_, called _Gums_. Yet in strict speaking
they are all so many _Rosins_.

16. §. Secondly, a _Gum_, and every _Oylie Gum_, is originally a _Milky
Liquor_, having a greater quantity of _Water_ mixed with its _Oyly
Parts_; and which for that reason, will be made to dissolve either in
_Water_ or _Oyl_. Of this kind are _Sagapen_, _Opopanax_, _Ammoniac_,
and others.

17. §. The third sort of _Gum_, is that which is _Unoylie_, and which
therefore dissolveth only in _Water_, as _Gum-arabick_, the _Gum_
of _Cherry-Tree_, and others such like. This _Gum_, though commonly
so called, yet is properly but a dryed _Mucilage_: being originally
nothing else but the _Mucilaginous Lympha_ issuing from the _Vessels_
of the _Tree_. In like manner, as it doth from _Cumfry_, _Mallow_,
and divers other _Plants_: and even from the _Cucumer_. The _Vessels_
whereof, upon cutting cross, yield a _Lympha_, which is plainly
_Mucilaginous_, and which being well dryed, at length becomes a kind of
_Gum_, or rather a hardened _Mucilage_. In like manner, the _Gums_ of
_Plum-tree_, _Cherry-tree_ and the like, are nothing else but _dryed
Mucilages_. Or, if we will take the word in its widest sense, then
all _Gums_ are originally, either a _Terebinth_, or a _Milk_, or a
_Mucilage_.

18. §. I have likewise made divers Observations of the _Tasts_,
_Smells_, and _Colours_ of _Plants_, and of their _Contents_, since
those I last published: and that both for the finding out the true
_Causes_ of their _Generation_, and also the applying of them unto
_Medical_ and other _Uses_. Of which hereafter.




                                CHAP. V.

                    _Of the_ Figuration _of_ Trunks.


THE _Fifth Head_, shall be, of the _Figuration_ of _Trunks_. Which
also, as well as the _making_ of _Liquors_, dependeth upon the
_Structure_ of the _Parts_. As _First_, almost all _Shrubs_ (_cæteris
paribus_) have a greater number of _Aer-Vessels_; and those of a
smaller Size; and consequently much spread abroad, as most easily
yielding to the _magnetick_ Power of the _Aer_, according as we have
more fully demonstrated, in speaking of the _Vegetation_ of _Roots_: as
in _Elder_, _Hazel_, _Fig_, _Sumach_, and the like. By which spreading,
the said _Aer-Vessels_ do sooner, and more easily strike into the
_Barque_, and so produce collateral _Buds_ and _Branches_, and that
upon the first rising of the _Body_ from the _Root_: that is, the
_Plant_ becomes a _Shrub_.


2. §. BUT if the said _Aer-Vessels_ are very large, they will not
yield so easily to shoot out collaterally; and so the _Trunk_ grows
up taller and more entire: as in _Oak_, _Wallnut_, _Elm_, &c. wherein
they are exceeding large, is seen. Hence also the _Vine_, if supported,
will grow to a prodigious length. And _Hops_ and _Bryony_, are some of
the tallest, amongst all _Annual Growths_: the _Aer-Vessels_ of all
which, are very large. Whereas _Borage_, and many other like _Plants_,
although the _Pores_ of their _Parenchyma_, are vastly wide, and
filled with _Sap_; yet because their _Aer-Vessels_ are small, they are
therefore but _Dwarf-Plants_. Wherefore the tallness or advancement
of a _Plant_ or _Tree_, dependeth not upon the _Plenty_ of _Sap_, how
great soever, but on the _Largeness_ of the _Aer-Vessels_.


3. §. AGAIN, as a _Plant_ or _Tree_ grows either _Shrubby_, or _Tall_
and _Entire_, according to the _Size_ of the said _Vessels_: so from
their _Position_, doth it grow _Slender_ or _Thick_. So, where they
keep more within the compass of a _Ring_, as in _Elm_, and _Ash_, the
_Tree_, in proportion, usually grows taller, and less thick. But where
the said _Vessels_ are spread more abroad, and especially are postured
in _Rays_, as they are in _Oak_, the _Tree_ grows very thick. Because
the said _Vessels_ thus standing all along nearer to the _Insertions_,
there is a more ready and copious passage of the _Aer_ out of the one
into the other; and so the _Diametral_ growth of the _Wood_ is more
promoted.


4. §. LASTLY, from the same general cause it is, That the _Trunks_ of
_Vegetables_ are either _Round_ or _Angular_. Those of all _Trees_
are _Round_. Because the _Barque_, being here thicker, and the
_Aer-Vessels_ bound up with a greater quantity of _Wood_; the _Aer_
hath not sufficient power to move them, and the _Barque_ with them,
into those various _Positions_ or _Figurations_, as the _Trunks_ of
_Herbs_ do yield to.

5. §. Yet the cause of the various _shapes_ of the _Trunk_, is not the
_Aer_ alone; but partly, the _Principles_ of the _Plants_ themselves,
in conjunction therewith; according to the predominion whereof,
and chiefly of some certain kind of _Salt_ or _Salts_, as I shall
hereafter[63] more particularly explicate, the _Trunk_ is _Square_,
_Triangular_, _Pentangular_, or otherwise _Figured_. And thus much in
general of the _Figuration_ of _Trunks_.

     [63] _B. 4. P. 1. Ch. 6._




                                CHAP. VI.

                      _Of the_ Motions _of_ Trunks.


THE _Motions_ also of _Trunks_ are various. Principally _Four_; _sc._
_Ascending_, _Descending_, _Horizontal_, and _Spiral_. The cause of
the _Ascent_ of a _Plant_, is a certain _Magnetick Correspendence_
betwixt the _Aer_ and the _Aer-Vessels_ of a _Plant_; the _Motion_ and
_Tendency_ whereof, the whole _Plant_ follows. This I have asserted,
and I think, clearly demonstrated in my _First_ and _Second_ =Books= of
the _Anatomy_ of _Plants_. I will here add this plain _Experiment_.

2. §. Take a Box of _Moulds_, with a hole bored in the bottom, wide
enough to admit the _Stalk_ of a _Plant_, and set it upon stilts half a
yard or more above ground. Then lodg in the _Mould_ some _Plant_, for
Example a _Bean_, in such sort, that the _Root_ of the _Bean_ standing
in the _Moulds_ may poynt upwards, the _Stalk_ towards the ground. As
the _Plant_ grows, it will follow, that at length the _Stalk_ will
rise upward, and the _Root_, on the contrary, arch it self downward.
Which evidently shews, That it is not sufficient, that the _Root_ hath
_Earth_ to shoot into, or that its _Motion_ is only an _Appetite_ of
being therein lodged, which way soever that be: but that its nature is,
though within the _Earth_ already, yet to change its _Position_, and
to _move Downwards_. And so likewise of the _Trunk_, that it rises,
when a _Seed_ sprouts, out of the Ground, not meerly because it hath an
_Appetite_ of being in the open _Aer_; for in this Experiment it is so
already; yet now makes a new _Motion_ upwards.


3. §. BUT although the _Natural Motion_ of the _Trunk_ be to _Ascend_;
yet is it forced oftentimes to _Descend_. For the _Trunk-Roots_ growing
out of some _Plants_ near the ground, and shrinking thereinto, like so
many _Ropes_, do pluck the _Trunk_ annually lower and lower into the
ground together with them; as may be seen in _Scrophularia_, _Jacobæa_,
and many other _Plants_.


4. §. IF these _Trunk-Roots_ break out only about the _bottom_ of the
_Trunk_, as in the aforesaid _Plants_, then the _Trunk_ gradually
_Descends_ into the _Earth_, and is turned into a _Root_. But if it
be very _slender_, and the _Trunk-Roots_ break forth _all along_ it,
then it _Creeps_ horizontally; the said _Roots_ tethering it, as it
trails along, to the ground; as _Strawberry_, _Cinquefoyl_, _Mint_,
_Scordium_, &c.


5. §. AS to their _Spiral Motion_, it is to be noted; That the _Wood_
of all _Convolvulus_ or _Winders_, stands more close and round together
in or near the Center, thereby making a round, and slender _Trunk_.
To the end, it may be more tractable, to the power of the external
_Motor_, what ever that be: and also more secure from breaking by its
winding _Motion_.

6. §. Wherefore, _Convolvulus_ do not wind by any peculiar Nature or
_Genius_, which other _Trunks_ have not; but because their _Parts_ are
disposed so, as to render them more sequaceous to the external _Motor_.
Even as the _Claspers_ of a _Vine_, having the like _Structure_, have
also a _Motion_ of _Convolution_: whereas the _Branches_ themselves
upon a contrary account, move in a _straight Line_.

7. §. The _Convolution_ of _Plants_, hath been observed only in those
that Climb. But it seems probable, that many others do also _wind_;
in which, the main _Stalk_, is as the _Axis_ to the _Branches_ round
about. ♦ _B. 2. P. 1. Ch. 1._ ♦ Of which number, I conceive, are all
those whose _Roots_ are twisted; a _Motion_ we observed in speaking
of the _Root_. Whether it be so, or not the Experiment may easily be
made by tying a _Thred_ upon any of the _Branches_; setting down the
respect it then hath to any Quarter in the _Heavens_: for, if it shall
appear in two or three Months, to have changed its Situation towards
some other Quarter; it is a certain proof hereof. And that hereby the
_Roots_ of many _Plants_ become twisted; the _Motion_ beginning in the
_Stalk_, and ending at the bottom of the _Root_, which stands always
fixed in the same place.

8. §. The _Convolution_ of _Trunks_, is made not _one_, but _divers_
ways; some moving by _South_ from _East_ to _West_; and others from
_West_ to _East_. Wherefore it seemeth, that as the _Efficient Cause_
of _Convolution_, is not within the _Plant_, but external: so also,
that it is not _One_, but that there are _Two Great Efficients_ of this
_Motion_; _sc._ the _Sun_ and the _Moon_. Some winding together with
the _Sun_, in its _Diurnal Motion_, (or, if the Earth moves, then,
Inclining to the _Sun_) by _South_ from _East_ to _West_. And others
winding with the _Moon_, in its _Monthly Motion_, from _West_ to _East_.

9. §. This possibly, may also be one _sensible_ way of distinguishing
betwixt _Solar_, and _Lunar Plants_. Thus far, in general, of the
_Motions_ of _Trunks_.




                               CHAP. VII.

            _Of the_ Nature _of_ Timber _or_ Trunks, _as they
                        serve for_ Mechanick Use.


THE last thing I purposed to speak of, is, Those several _Qualities_
of _Timber_ or of _Trunks_, by which they are fitted for _Mechanical
Use_. As _Hardness_, _Softness_, _Fastness_, _Clevesomeness_,
_Toughness_, _Brittleness_, _Durableness_, or any of the same
_Qualities_ compounded. The _Visible Causes_ whereof are observable,
_Partly_, in the _Structure_ of the several _Parts_; _sc._ the
_Insertions_, _Sap-Vessels_ and _Aer-Vessels_; as to the _Number_,
_Size_, or _Position_ of any of them. And _partly_, in the _Nature_ of
the _Parts_; I mean such as is _manifest to sense_. According to our
clear and distinct observing of all which Causes, we may understand,
Wherefore any _Wood_ is made use of for any certain purpose. And also,
wherein fitly to apply it to further _Use_. In order to which, a
compleat History of the _Mechanical Uses_ of _Vegetables_ would very
much conduce. I shall for the present give some _Instances_.


2. §. AS _First_, some _Woods_ are _soft_, as _Deal_, and _Sallow_.
Yet from different Causes. _Deal_, from the great _Porosity_ of the
_Wood_ it self, or the large _Pores_ amongst the _Sap-Vessels_. But
_Sallow_, from the great number of _Aer-Vessels_ spread all over it.
And therefore, though they are both _soft_, yet will not serve for the
same purposes; _Sallow_ being well wrought upon, which way soever you
cut it: but _Deal_, especially the white _Deal_, if it be cut cross, it
tears, and will never polish or work smooth.

3. §. Again, in _Sallow_, by the equal spreading of the _Aer-Vessels_,
the _Softness_ is equal or alike in all _Parts_. For which cause
it maketh an excellent _Coal_ for _Painters Scribets_. Because it
doth not only make a _light Stroak_, but every where _certain_; and
so doth not disturb the even _Motion_ of the _Hand_. For the same
cause, _Shoemakers_ also make use of it for their _Carving-boards_.
Because being every where equally soft, it turns not the edge of their
_Knives_, Which _Deal_ would presently do; because though very soft
in some places, yet in others ’tis hard; that is to say, on the inner
_Verge_ of every annual _Ring_ of _Wood_, where the old _Sap-Vessels_
grow much more compact and close together.


4. §. AGAIN, some _Woods_ are _soft_, but not _fast_; others are
_both_, as _Linn_: its _Softness_, depending on the numerousness
and equal spreading of the _Aer-Vessels_; its _Fastness_, on the
closeness of the true _Wood_, and the shortness, and smallness of
the _Insertions_. For which cause, it is of excellent use for many
purposes; and particularly, for _small Sculpture_: such as may
sometimes be seen for the Frames of _Looking-Glasses_, or of smaller
_Pictures_ in _Water-Colours_.


5. §. SOME _Woods_, again, are _fast_, and _hard_, as _Elm_. Its
_hardness_ depending upon the closeness of the _Wood_. Its _fastness_,
_Partly_, upon the same cause; and _partly_, on the smalness of
the _Insertions_; as also on the fewness of the _Aer-Vessels_ in
proportion with the _Wood_; and on the _thwart_ and _cross Position_
of many of them. Hence it is, that _Elm_, of all others, is the most
_Cross-grain’d Timber_; that is, cleaveth so unevenly, to and fro,
according to the _cross Position_ of the said _Vessels_.

6. §. Hence also it cleaveth the _most Difficultly_. Even then, when
it is without any _Knots_. For which reason it is always used, as best
for the _Hub_ of a _great Wheel_. As also for _Water-Pipes_, and for
_Pumps_. Not because it is the most _durable Wood_; but because it will
not _split_ or _crack_, either in the _working_, or _afterwards_. For
the very same reason, it is used for _Coffins_; that is, because, it
will not _split_ in working: not because it will endure longest under
ground; for _Pales_ are always made of _Oak_. So also the _Ladles_ and
_Soles_ of a _Mill-wheel_ are always made of _Elm_; as also the _Keel_
of a _Boat_, _sc._ lest they should _split_: but the other _Parts_ are
made of _Oak_.

7. §. It may here also be noted, That the _Planks_ commonly called
_Groaning-Boards_, lately exposed, as a kind of _Prodigy_, to the view
and hearing of many People, were of _Elm_. The _Aer-Vessels_ of this
_Wood_, being, though not more numerous, yet more ample, than in any
other _Timber_. So that upon the application of the _Red-hot-Iron_,
as was usual, and thereby the _Rarifaction_ of the _Aer_ and _Watery
Parts_ in the _Timber_; every _Vessel_ became, as it were a little
_Wind-Pipe_ for their _Expiration_. And as a great many Drops falling
together in a showr of Rain; so a great many of these _Pipes_ playing
together, might make a kind of big or groaning noyse.


8. §. AS _Elm_, of all _Woods_, is one of the _fastest_; So, on the
contrary, of all _hard Woods_, _Oak_ is the most _Cleavesome_, or
_splitteth_ the most _easily_. The cause whereof is, _partly_, the
_Largeness_ of the _Insertions_; and _partly_, the _Diametral_ or
_Radiated Position_ of most of the _Aer-Vessels_: upon both which
accounts, wherever a _crack_ is once begun, ’tis easily continued
throughout the _Diameter_ of the _Trunk_.


9. §. AGAIN, some _Woods_ are _hard_, _fast_, and _tough_. So is
_Ash_, and especially _Beech_. _Hard_ and _fast_, from some of the
same Causes, as _Elm_. _Tough_ not from the _Structure_, but from the
_Nature_ of the _Parts_; whose _Principles_ are united in a more exact
proportion. Wherefore _London-Cars_ have the _Rings_ of their _Wheels_
of _Beech_; because it _tears_ more difficulty than even _Ash_ it self.
Whence also for _large Screws_, there is no _Wood_ like it. But for
_Small Screws_, of about an _Inch Diameter_, _Birch_ is the best; as
being, though not so _hard_, yet more _tough_.


10. §. THE more _Brittle_ a _Wood_ is, ’tis likewise usually the more
_durable_. So _Oak_, which, with respect to its _hardness_, is not
a _tough_, but very _brittle Wood_, is almost as _durable_ as any.
Whereas _Beech_, _Birch_, and the like, although very _tough_; yet
for _Duration_, are of no service; for there are no _Woods_ will rot
sooner: and therefore, though strong enough, yet unfit to make any
_Standing Parts_ of _Building_, or of _Furniture_; especially in wet
and moist places. Because, these _Woods_, having a less proportion of
_Oyl_, than there is in _Oak_; they are apter to imbibe the moisture
even of a _dank Aer_; by which moisture, they either _Rot_, or breed
_Worms_, which destroy them.


11. §. HENCE it is, that what we call the _Heart_ of _Timber_, as it
is more _brittle_, so also more _durable_; _sc._ Because more _Oylie_.
So that which is called the _Sap_ of _Oak_, is much more _tough_ than
the _Heart_, although the _Heart_ be more _durable_. That is to say,
the older the _Wood_ is, the _Watery Parts_ are the more evapourated,
whilst the _Oylie_ still remaine, as a kind of _Tincture_ or _Extract_
in the _Wood_. Even as we see, that the older _Seeds_ of any one
_Kind_, are more _Oylie_ than those that are green and young. So that
the _Oylie_ or _Rosinous Parts_ of the _Sap_, are a kind of _Embalming_
to the _Heart_, or older _Part_ of a _Tree_, securing it from the
destructive impressions of the _Aer_. For which Cause it is, that
_Oak_, _Yew_, _Cocus_, _Guajacum_, &c. which are _Oylie Woods_, have
always much _Heart_, whereas _Birch_, _Alder_, _Beech_, _Maple_, which
are very _Unoylie_, have never any _Heart_.


12. §. FROM hence likewise we may understand the Cause of the
_Toughness_ of _Flax_: what we call _Flax_, being only the
_Sap-Vessels_, or _Lignous Fibres_ of the _Barque_. And generally, the
_Barque_ of any _Tree_, as of _Willow_ (whereof are usually made a sort
of _Ropes_) is very _tough_. The _Vessels_ being here younger, and
less _Oylie_ than in the _Wood_. So likewise _Hemp_, is nothing else
but the _Sap-Vessels_ of the _Barque_ of the _Plant_ so called. And
_Scotch-Cloath_, is only the _Housewifery_ of the same _Parts_ of the
_Barque_ of _Nettle_.


13. §. WHENCE it is very probable, that there are many other _Plants_,
as well as the above named, whereof might be made good _Tow_. And of
some, especially in some respects, better than of _Flax_ it self.
Because that even _Hemp_, although it will not make so fine a
_Staple_, as _Flax_ (for all our fine _Hollands_ are made of _Flax_)
yet _Flax_, which is but of the same fineness as _Hemp_, will never,
by all the Art yet known, be made so white as _Hemp_ is made. The
_Qualities_ therefore of the best _Tow_, that can be in Nature, are
that the _Staple_ be _long_, _small_, _tough_, and _white_. So that if
in the _Barque_ of any _Plant_, we can find these _Qualities_, or any
of them, to excell; we may be sure, it will be of better use, in some
respects, for the making of _Cloath_, or other purpose, than _Flax_ it
self.


14. §. I WILL conclude with one _Instance_ more, and that is as to
_Grafting_. The good and happy success whereof, doth certainly depend
upon the suitableness or respondence betwixt the several _Parts_ of the
_Stock_ and _Cyon_; as the _Barque_, _Wood_, and _Pith_; and that both
as to the _Number_, _Size_, and _Position_ of the said _Parts_, and of
their several _Pores_ or _Vessels_: according to the degrees whereof,
the _Conjunction_ (_cæteris paribus_) will be more or less prosperous.
So that of all such _Conjunctions_ as are found to be apt and taking,
and which some have learned not without long Practice and Experience;
another, only by comparing the _Branches_ of _Trees_ together, may with
little trouble, and in much less time, inform himself. By the same
means, some _Conjunctions_ which seem to be strange, as _Quince_ and
_Pear_, _White Thorn_ and _Medlar_, &c. do yet, by the respondence of
their _Parts_, as well as by _Experience_, appear to be good. And there
is no doubt, but that many _Conjunctions_ not yet tryed, or not known
to have been so, may upon the same ground, be tryed with good success.

15. §. The chief Use of _Grafting_ and _Inoculation_, is, That they
_Accelerate_ the growth of _Good Fruit_. The _Cause_ whereof, is the
_Knot_, which is always made in the _Conjunction_. By means of which,
all the _Sap_ is strained, and so ascendeth up into the _Graff_ or
_Bud_, both _Purer_ and in less _Quantity_; and is therefore better and
sooner concocted. Hence, the smaller the _Fruit_ of any _Tree_, though
it be not the best, yet the _Sap_ being there, in _less Quantity_,
is the _sooner ripe_. On the contrary, where the _Sap_ ascendeth too
freely, it doth not only _retard_ the growth of the _Fruit_, but
produceth _Barrenness_; as is seen in those _luxuriant Branches_,
where it runs all up to _Leaves_. Hence also _Vines_, by _Bleeding_,
become more _Fruitful_: that is, by the Effusion of _Part_ of the
_Sap_, there is a more easier _melioration_ of that which remains.
Even as _Phlebotomy_ doth oftentimes produce a more healthful and
better _Habit_ of our own _Bodies_. To conclude, the _lessening_ the
_Quantity_, and thereby the _melioriation_ of the ascending _Sap_, by
_Knots_, is _Natures_ own contrivance; as is seen in _Sugar-Cane_,
_Corn_, and other _Plants_.

SIR,

_AFTER I had finished the foregoing_ Books, _In which, I conceive,
as far as_ Glasses _will yet lead us, I have clearly Describ’d and
Delineated the_ Structure _of a_ Plant; _and have endeavour’d, in some
part, to Unfold the_ Reason _and_ Scope _of_ Nature _therein: I was
willing to sit down, and leave what remained, to the_ Improvements _of
the Present and Succeeding_ Ages.

_But in Discourse upon this Subject,_ You _have been pleased frequently
to insist, That I should by no means omit, to give likewise, some
Examples of the_ Mechanisme _of_ Nature _in all the other_ Parts. _The
Performance whereof therefore, next to the_ Obedience _I owe to the_
Royal Society, _is to be looked upon, as a Due to the Authority which
Your Judgment hath over me._

_This I have said, that, if what is herein done, shall prove acceptable
unto_ Learned Men; _they may know, To whom they are once more to give
their Thanks: After they have so often done it, upon (a better score)
the Publishing of Your own Excellent Works. In which, there seems
to be a Question, Whether Your Continual Endeavours, to enlarge the
Bounds of_ Natural Knowledge, _or Your Successes therein, have been
the Greater. So that, whereas_ Nobility _in some, doth only serve to
lift them, like_ Jupiter’s Satellits, _out of sight:_ You, _by giving
a greater Light, have drawn all Mens Eyes upon_ You. _And whilest
there are many, in all_ Ages, _fond of Preheminency in the Conduct of_
Popular Affairs; _who yet rarely hit the Mark they aim at; or aim at
That they pretend:_ You _have thought fit, rather to separate_ Your
Self, _to that more Innocent, and more Noble Sort of_ Wisdom, _which
lieth, not in the_ Arts _of_ Conceiling, _but in_ Discovering, _the
Truth of Things._

_That we may have many to imitate_ You _herein, cannot but be heartily
wish’d by all, who regard the Honour of their own Country; as it is,
with much Zeal, by_

                                  Sir,

                                 PART I.




                                CHAP. I.

              _Of the_ Protections _and_ Folds _of_ Leaves.


IN THE _General Anatomy_ of _Plants_, I have assigned one whole
_Chapter_[64] to the _Germen_ and _Leaf_. Since then, I have
occasionally made divers _Remarques_ of the same; both with the Naked
Eye, as there, and also with the _Microscope_. The _Principal_ whereof,
I shall here set down; without repeating any from thence; or obliging
my self strictly to the _Order_ there used.

     [64] _Lib. 1. Ch. 4._

2. §. That which in a _Germen_, first occurs to the _Eye_, is the
_Protection_ of the _Leaves_, or the various _Methods_ which Nature
takes to preserve them from the _Injuries_ both of the _Ground_, and of
the _Weather_. To the Instances formerly given, I shall add these that
follow.


3. §. AND _First_, it is observable of the young _Buds_ of _Ammi_,
that lest they should be bruised, or starved, upon their first
_Eruption_ from under the Ground; they are couched, as _Firn_ is
rowl’d, inward; each _Bud_, against the _Base_ of the _Stalk_ of the
foregoing _Leaves_, and most exactly laid up within the _Membranes_
thence produced: Just as the Child in the Womb, lies with his _Head_
against his _Knees_; or as it is afterwards embraced with the _Armes_
of the Nurse. And it is a general Rule of Nature, where the _Stalks_
of the _Leaves_ are so long, that they cannot lap one over another,
and where no other special _Protection_ is provided; for the bottoms
of the _Stalks_ to be produced into broad _Membranes_, as Blankets
to the succeeding _Buds_; as in _Crowfoot_, _Dovesfoot_, _Claver_,
_Cransbill_, _Strawberry_, _Yarrow_, and others. And sometimes instead
of two _Skins_ lapped one over another, there is one entire _Skin_,
produced from the _Stalk_, in which as within a _Secundine_, the _Bud_
is safely shrowded; and which, in its Growth, it gradually breaks open.


4. §. THE same is also observable in _Dock_, _Sorrel_, _Bistort_, and
all other _Plants_ of this Kindred; with this difference, That every
_Veil_ or _Secundine_ is not here produced from the _Stalk_ of the
_Leaf_; but hath its _Original Distinct_ from it. And whereas in the
former, every _Bud_ hath only one to it self: ♦ _Tab. 41._ ♦ in these
_Plants_, every lesser _Leaf_, together with its own proper _Veil_,
is always inclosed, with the next greater _Leaf_, in another _Veil_
common to them both; and both these with the next, in another; and so
on to the greatest. These _Veils_ are extream thin, and have very few
_Vessels_; being so many meer transparent _Skins_. For which reason,
there is always found a _Mucilage_ or clear _Gelly_, between every
_Leaf_, and its _Veil_, and between _Veil_ and _Veil_. The one, thus
preserving the other, (as do the _Humors_ and _Membranes_ of the Eye)
from drying and shrinking up, and thereby from becoming useless for the
_Protection_ of the _Plant_.


5. §. THE _Orchis_, and other _Plants_ of this kindred, because they
_Spring_ and _Flower_ early, when the mornings are cold, have a double
_Sheath_, or _Blanket_ over all. The _Buds_ of some _Herbs_ (as of
_Plantain_) having no _Hairs_ growing on them, are covered with _Hairy
Thrums_. And the _Nettle_ hath _Bastard-Leaves_, or _Interfoyls_
between _Leaf_ and _Leaf_, for the preservation of its _Stings_.


6. §. ANOTHER Sort of _Protection_ is seen in _Wild Clary_, _White
Archangel_, and other _Plants_ of a like Shape. In which, the greater
_Leaves_ do still cover and inclose the lesser, not by being lapped
over them, ♦ _Tab. 41._ ♦ as where the _Leaves_ are more numerous, is
usual; but by a _Double Fore-Curl_ at the bottom of every two greater
_Leaves_; by which the little _Under-Bud_ is embraced, and so kept safe
and warm.


7. §. THE _Leaves_ of _Onions_ are all _Pipes_ one within another.
These _Pipes_ are every where entire, saving about the middle, where
they have a small _Aperture_; ♦ _Tab. 42._ ♦ common to all of them,
even the most minute in the Centre: not being a forced _Crack_, but a
_Door_ originally formed, for the issuing of every lesser _Pipe_, out
of a greater.


8. §. THE LAST I shall give, is that which is remarkable in _Common
Sumach_. The _Buds_ whereof, being exceeding tender, ♦ _Tab. 41._
♦ Nature appears sollicitous in a peculiar manner, for their
preservation. For whereas in other _Plants_, they are well enough
secured only by standing behind the _Stalks_ of the elder _Leaves_:
here they are lodged within the very _Body_ of the _Stalk_; as
entirely, as a _Kernel_ is within an _Apple_, or a _Fœtus_ in the
_Womb_. From whence it comes to pass that the _Basis_ of every _Stalk_
is extreamly swelled, as going Great with a _Bud_.


9. §. UPON THE removal of those _Parts_, which are contrived for the
_Protection_; the _Foulds_ and _Composture_ of the _Leaves_ do next
appear: all which are most aptly suited both to the _Number_ and
_Shape_ of the _Leaves_, and also their _Position_ upon the _Branch_.
In the _First_ =Book=[65] I have given Examples of these _Eight
Sorts_, sc. the _Plain Lap_, the _Plicature_, the _Duplicature_, the
_Multiplicature_, the _Single Roll_, the _Double Back-Roll_, the
_Double Fore-Role_, ♦ _Tab. 42._ ♦ and the _Treble-Roll_. To which I
shall add _Four_ or _Five_ more.

     [65] _Ch. 4._

10. §. And _First_, in some _Plants_, as _Ground-Ivy_, _St. Johns
Wort_, and divers others, where the _Leaves_ are small, pretty
numerous, and grow by pairs, they have no _Fould_, but stand Flat and
Tangent, like a pair of _Battledores_ clapt together.

11. §. They have the like _Posture_ in _Baum_; saving, that here the
Edges of the _Leaves_ are a little _curled_ backward. Not _Rolled_, a
_Curl_ being but the beginning of a _Roll_. So the several _Labels_ of
a _Grounsel-Leaf_ are all laid in a _Back-Curl_.

12. §. The _Leaves_ of some _Plants_, as _Horehound_, _White Lamium_,
_Nettle_, and others, are likewise only Tangent, but are set with a
_Fore-Curle_. And the several _Labels_ or _Scallops_ of the _Leaf_ of
_Common Crowfoot_, are all _Curled_ Inward. But those of _Hepatica
aurea_, are composed into _Double Fore-Rolls_.


13. §. THE _Leaves_ of _Sage_, _Scabious_, _Red Lamium_, _Lychinis
Sylvestris_, and others, are neither couched one over another, as in
the _Bow-Lap_; nor plated, as in the _Flat Lap_; but being loosely
foulded, of every pair of _Leaves_, the half of one is reciprocally
received between the two halfs of another, and may therefore be
called the _Cleep_. ♦ _Tab. 42._ ♦ A _Position_ very well suited to
the Smalness of their Number, and the Equality of their Size, not so
well agreeing with the _Bow-Lap_; and the somewhat inward Posture
of the _Fibres_, not allowing the _Flat Lap_. Sometimes, as in
_Syringa_, where the _Leaves_ are broader, the _Cleep_ is joyned with a
_Fore-Curle_.


14. §. THE last I shall mention, is the _Plaite-Roll_, as in the
_Lapathum Alpinum_, which some call _English Rhubarb_. The _Leaves_
whereof are so very large, and the _Fibres_ so prominent; that besides
and under the two _Back-Rolls_, they are also laid in several _Plaits_,
and under those _Plaits_, again with lesser ones, all most exquisitely
Tucked up between the said _Fibres_: So, as neither to bruise the same,
nor yet to leave any Vacuity: whereby every _Leaf_, and the whole
_Bud_, lie close and round within their _Veils_.




                                CHAP. II.

             _Of those things which appear upon the_ Surface
                             _of the_ Leaf.


THESE are _Globular Excrescences_, _Spots_, _Hairs_, _Thorns_ and
_Prickles_: of all which, except _Spots_, I have spoken in the
_Appendix_ to the _Chapter_ of _Leaves_ in the _First_ =Book=.

2. §. Of the _Globulets_, it may here be further noted, That those
which are white, and lie sometimes like a fine Powder upon the _Leaf_,
were once transparent, as in _Bears-Ear_; their cleer _Liquor_ being
now evaporated to an _Extract_ of _White Flowers_. ♦ _Tab. 43._ ♦ This,
if licked off, will give you the _Tast_ of the more _Essential Content_
of the _Plant_; different from that perceived in chewing the _Leaf_.

3. §. For the observing of them, it may also be noted, That although
they often grow on both sides the _Leaf_ alike; yet sometimes, as
in _Ground-Ivy_, only or chiefly on the Back-Side. And that in many
_Plants_, where the elder _Leaves_ have none; on the young _Buds_ they
are very numerous; as in _Corin Tree_, _Sorrel_, and others.


4. §. AS for _Spots_, the smaller ones are observable not only in
_St. Johns-worts_, (in which _Plant_ only they are commonly taken
notice of) but also in _Rue_, ♦ _Tab. 43._ ♦ _Ground-Ivy_, _Pympernel_
or _Anagallis_, and divers other _Plants_, when held up against the
_Light_. The original whereof seems to be, at least in some, from the
_Globulets_ above mentioned; that is, when they break and dry away.
So the _Spots_ of _Rue-Leaves_, which in the _Refection_ of _Light_
look _black_, but upon the _Trajection_ thereof are _transparent_;
are so many little _Holes_, pounced half way through the thickness of
the _Leaf_, and seem as made, by the breaking and drying away of as
many _Globulets_. Whence also, as the _Globulets_ are best seen in the
younger _Leaves_, so these _Spots_ in the elder.


5. §. BESIDES these, and some others (as those in _Ladies-Thistle_)
which are Natural to the _Leaf_; there are also some _Spots_, or rather
_Streaks_, which are _Adventitious_; as those in the _Leaves_ of
_Sonchus_. ♦ _Tab. 43._ ♦ The Cause whereof, is a small flat _Insect_,
of a grey _Colour_, and about ⅙ᵗʰ of an Inch long. Which neither
ranging in bredth, nor striking deep into the _Leaf_; eats so much only
as lies just before it, and so runs scudding along betwixt the _Skin_
and the _Pulp_ of the _Leaf_; leaving a whitish _Streak_ behind it,
where the _Skin_ is now loose, as the measure of its Voyage.


6. §. THE Original and several kinds of _Thorns_, I have describ’d in
the above said _Appendix_. I only add, that the very _Leaves_ of some
_Plants_, if they stand till the second year, are changed into so many
_Thorns_, as in the _Furz_.

7. §. They are of Use, not only for the _Protection_ of the _Bud_; but
likewise, for the support of the _Plant_; as is observable in those
_Climbers_, which are neither strong enough to stand of themselves;
nor yet, from their fragility, are capable of winding about another,
without being torn all to pieces. For which end also, these _Thorns_
grow not like _Buds_, erected; but poynt all downwards, like so
many _Tenters_ or _Hanging-hooks_: as in the _Bramble_, chiefly on
the _Stalks_; and in _Clivers_, ♦ _Tab. 43._ ♦ also on the _Leaves_
themselves; whereby they catch at any Thing that stands next them; and
so, although such slim and feeble _Plants_, yet easily climb to a very
great hight.


8. §. OF THE several _Figures_ of _Hairs_, and their Use, ♦ _B. 1. Ch.
4._ ♦ I have also spoken. As to one Use, _sc._ the _Protection_ they
give to the _Leaf_, ♦ _Tab. 43._ ♦ I shall here further note, That
the design of _Nature_, is the more evident if we consider, That all
_Leaves_ are not alike _Hairy_, nor at all times, nor in every part:
but differently, according to their _Age_, _Substance_, _Texture_, and
_Foulding_ up. Their _Age_; for there are many young _Buds_ covered
with a thick warm _Hair_, which afterwards dries up and disappears,
as useless; as those of the _Vine_, _Golden Liverwort_, &c. Their
_Substance_; so those _Buds_ which are tenderest, and would sooner feel
the cold, if naked, have the fullest _Hair_; as of _Thistle_, _Mullen_,
_Burdock_, and others. Their _Structure_; therefore those _Leaves_,
whose _Fibres_ stand more prominent or above their _Surface_, lest the
cold should nip them, are covered with greater Store of _Hair_; as in
_Moth-Mullen_, _Garden-Clary_, and the like. And their _Fould_; it
being observable, That those _Leaves_ which are folded up inward, have
little or no _Hair_ on their inner, but only on their Back-Sides, which
are open to the _Aer_; as is visible in _Corin_, _Warden_, _Golden
Liverwort_, and others.

9. §. Add hereto, That where there is Store of _Hair_, Nature is the
less sollicitous for other _Covers_; and where there is not, she is
more. So the _Leaves_ of _Beans_ and _Peasen_, of _Nettle_, _Plantain_,
&c. not being _Hairy_, have each a _Surfoyl_, or else certain _Hairy
Thrums_, to protect them. And those _Plants_ which have neither, are
such as have a _Hotter Juyce_, and so less subject to the impressions
of _Cold_, as _Speerwort_, _Scurvygrass_, _Watercress_, _Fenil_, and
most of the _Umbelliferous_ Kind.

10. §. _Hair_ is of use to preserve young _Buds_, not only, from the
cold _Aer_, but also from too much _Wet_; which, if it were contiguous,
especially in _Winter_, would often rot and destroy them. But being
made to stand off in drops at the ends of the _Hair_, doth not hurt,
but refresh them. Thus doth _Nature_ make the meanest Things sometimes
subserve to the best Ends.




                               CHAP. III.

     _Of the_ Figure _of the_ Leaf; _and the Apparent_ Position _of
                              the_ Fibres.


THAT which in the _Leaf_ offers it self next to be observed, is
its _Figure_. This is infinitely varied with the several Kinds of
_Plants_: and there are some, which have _Leaves_ (besides the two
first _Dissimilar_ ones) of Two Kinds or Two distinct _Figures_; as the
_Bitter-Sweet_, the common _Little Bell_, _Valerian_, _Lady-Smocks_,
and others. For the _Under Leaves_ of _Bitter-Sweet_, are Entire; the
Upper, with two _Lobes_: the Under _Leaves_ of the _Little Bell_,
like those of _Pancy_; the Upper, like those of _Carnation_, or of
_Sweet-William_. And in some _Plants_, Nature affecteth a Kind of
_Irregularity_; the _Leaves_ whereof are of no one certain _Figure_; as
in _Dragon_, _Peony_, _Bishops-Weed_, &c.


2. §. BUT the _Leaves_ of most _Plants_, have a Regular _Figure_;
and this Regularity, both in Length and Circuit, always defineable.
In _Length_; by the Proportion between the several _Leaves_ upon one
_Stalk_, ♦ _Tab. 46._ ♦ or between the several _Lobes_ upon one _Leaf_.
So the _Leaves_ of _Clematis Sylv. major_, which stand by Ternaries,
shorten by equal _Proportions_, that is to say, if, the chief _Fiber_
of each, be divided into equal _Parts_; their several Lengths are not
as Ten, Eight, and Four; but as Ten, Eight, and Six. So the _Lobes_ and
_Fibers_ of _Clematis Virginiana Hederæ folio_, of _Artenuisa_, &c.
shorten in like manner by equal Proportions. The same is observable
in measuring, upon a _Gooseberry-Leaf_, ♦ _Tab. 46._ ♦ from the Poynt
of the first _Lobe_, to the first _Angle_; from thence, to the second
Poynt; from thence, to the second Angle; and from thence to the third
Poynt.

3. §. But in many, the Proportion is different. So in the _Leaves_ of
the _Lesser Maple_; the shortning of the _smaller Lobes_, with respect
to the middlemost; is not Equal, but Double to that of the middlemost,
with respect to the Greater. For if their chief _Fibres_ be divided
into Equal Parts, they are as Eleven, Nine, and Five. On the contrary,
in the _Leaves_ of _Althæa fruticosa Pentaphylloidea_, the middlemost
_Lobes_ shorten by a greater Proportion than the Least; all three being
as Ten, Fourteen, and Twenty.


4. §. WITH respect to the _Circumference_, the _Figure_ of most
_Leaves_ is very Complex. Yet Two things are evident. First, that all
Regular _Leaves_, are defined or measured out by _Circles_; that is,
by the _Arches_ or _Segments_ of several _Circles_, having either the
same, or divers _Centers_ and _Diameters_. Secondly, That the Length of
the _Leaf_, or of the chief _Fiber_ thereof, is the _Standard Measure_
for the _Diameters_ of these _Circles_: these being either its full
Length, or certain equal parts substracted, or multiplied; as half its
Length, or its Length and half, &c.


5. §. TO make this appear, I shall give several Instances: of some,
where both the Edges are of one Measure; and of others, where they are
different. And of both kinds, where they are measured by fewer, and
where by more _Circles_.

6. §. The _Leaf_ of _Lagopus major fol. pennat._ is measured by One
_Circle_, the same on both Edges, whose _Diametre_ is Thrice the Length
of the _Leaf_.

7. §. That of _Syderitis Salviæ fol._ by Two _Circles_: the _Diameter_
of the Lower, being Twice the Length of the _Leaf_; ♦ _Tab. 44._ ♦ of
the upper, the Length and half. In both these the _Circles_ are drawn
Outward; that is, with their Centers some where upon the middlemost or
chief _Fiber_ of the _Leaf_.

8. §. That of _Orange-Tree_, is also measured by Two _Circles_: but
one of them repeated with _Opposite Centers_. That next the _Cone_ of
the _Leaf_, is drawn Inward; that is, with the _Center_ no where upon
the _Leaf_, but without it. The _Diameter_ hereof is just the Length
of the _Leaf_. ♦ _Tab. 44._ ♦ The midle part of the Edge is measured
by the same _Circle_, only drawn Outward. The lower _Circle_ next the
_Stalk_, is drawn Inward, as the upper; and its _Diameter_ Three times
the Length of the _Leaf_.

9. §. The _Leaf_ of the _Venetian Vetch_, is measured by Three
_Circles_. That next the _Cone_, drawn Inward; the _Diameter_ whereof
is Twice the Length of the _Leaf_; the next is drawn Outward; ♦ _Tab.
44._ ♦ whereof the _Diameter_, is just the Length. The third or
lowermost, is drawn also Outward; and its _Diameter_, half the Length.
So that they all lessen by an Equal Proportion.

10. §. The _Leaf_ of _Great Laserwort_, is also measured by Three
_Circles_; all drawn Outward, and one of them Repeated. The _Diameter_
of that next the _Cone_, is Half the Length of the _Leaf_; ♦ _Tab. 45._
♦ of the next, Thrice the Length; of the Third, just the Length; the
lowermost, is the same with the First.

11. §. That of _Broad Leav’d Laserwort_, is also measured with Three
_Circles_; and one of them repeated with _Opposite Centers_. The
_Diameter_ of the First, is Half the Length of the _Leaf_; ♦ _Tab.
44._ ♦ of the Second, Twice the Length; of the Third, just the Length:
all of them drawn Outward. That next the _Stalk_, is the same with the
First; only drawn Inward.

12. §. The _Figure_ of the _Leaf_ of the _Cornelian Cherry_, is exactly
that of the foregoing, Inverted: the same measure there beginning at
the _Base_, ♦ _Tab. 44._ ♦ and ending at the _Cone_; which here begins
at the _Cone_, and ends at the _Base_: as by comparing their Draughts
together may be observ’d.


13. §. IN ALL, the foregoing Examples, both the Edges of the _Leaves_
have the same _Measure_. But they have oftentimes, different ones; as
in these that follow.

14. § The _Leaf_ of _Althæa fruticosa_, is measured by Three _Circles_.
The left Edge (as the _Leaf_ lies with the backside upward) by One
_Circle_, but Twice repeated. For the _Diameter_ of the First, is the
Length of the _Leaf_; ♦ _Tab. 45._ ♦ the Second is the same, but drawn
upon another Center; the Third also the same, but drawn Inward. The
right Edg, is measur’d by Two _Circles_: the _Diameter_ of the First,
being the Length of the _Leaf_; of the Second, Half the Length.

15. §. That of _Black Poplar_, by Three; and each Edge by Three
repeated. On the left, the _Diameter_ of the First, is the Length of
the _Leaf_; ♦ _Tab. 45._ ♦ of the Second, Half the length; of the
Third, the Length and Half. The _Measure_ of the right Edge, is that of
the left, Inverted: the same _Measure_ there beginning at the _Base_,
and ending at the _Cone_; which here begins at the _Cone_, and ends at
the _Base_.

16. §. That of _Doronicum_, is measured by Three _Circles_, whereof,
one is repeated Once; and another Thrice. The right Edge by Two, and
One repeated. For the _Diameter_ of the First or that next the _Cone_;
is the Length of the _Leaf_; the next is the same, but drawn Outward;
the _Diameter_ of the Third, is Half the Length. The left Edge, by
Three _Circles_; ♦ _Tab. 45._ ♦ whereof One is repeated on the same
Edge, and Two, the same, as on the other. For the _Diameter_ of the
first, is the Length of the _Leaf_; of the Second, Four times the
Length; the Third, the same as the First; and of the Fourth, Half the
Length.

17. §. Lastly, that of _Mountain Calamint_ is measured by Four
_Circles_. ♦ _Tab. 45._ ♦ The left Edge, by Three _Circles_, of which,
the lowermost is once repeated: the right Edge also by Two; whereof the
nether is likewise once repeated.

18. §. It may seem, even from these Instances, no very unobvious
Conclusion; That all _Crooked Lines_, _Spiral_, _Helick_, _Elliptick_,
_Hyperbolick_, _Regular_, or _Irregular_; are made up of the _Arches_
of _Circles_, having either the same, or divers _Centers_ and
_Diameters_. And, as otherwise so from the _Contemplation_ of _Plants_,
men might first be invited to _Mathematical_ Enquirys.


19. §. TOGETHER with the _Figure_ of the _Leaf_, the _Position_ of
the _Fibers_, as it is apparent before Dissection, is observable;
especially on the back of the _Leaf_. Whereof I shall add, to what I
have said in the _First_ =Book=, the following _Remarques_.

20. §. First, that there are some _Leaves_, in which the first
Collateral _Fibres_ make _Right Angles_ with the Great one in the
midle: as the _Great-Maple_, the _Great Celandine_, _Chondrilla_, and
the rest, or many, of the _Intybous_ Kind; with some few others. But
that generally all the chief _Fibers_ of a _Leaf_, make _Acute Angles_
together: both where they stand collateral with the midle _Fiber_, as
in _Strawberry_; and where they all part at the _Stalk_, as in _Mallow_.

21. §. Again, that of these, there are some few, any two of whose
Defining _Fibres_ making two _Rays_ of equal Length, take in One Eighth
Part of a _Circle_, ♦ _Tab. 46, & 47._ ♦ as in _Mallow_, and in some
one Tenth: but in most they take in either one Twelfth part, as in
_Holy-Oak_; or one Sixth, as in _Sirynga_. So that where the _Fibres_
stand Collateral with one in the midle, if you suppose them to be
drawn out at _Opposite Angles_; or where the chief _Fibers_ part at
the _Stalk_, you only take in the _Stalk_; you will thereby divide a
_Circle_ into Eight, Twelve, or Six equal Parts; as in _Sirynga_, the
_Vine_ and others. And so likewise, where there are several _Sprigs_
upon one _Stem_, ♦ _Tab. 46, 47._ ♦ as in _Fenil_, _Hemlock_, and the
like: as will best be understood by the _Figures_.




                                CHAP. IV.

               _Of the_ Parts _and_ Texture _of the_ Leaf.


I COME next to observe the several _Parts_, whereof the _Leaf_ is
composed: and first the _Skin_. This being stript off the _Leaf_,
although to the bare Eye it looks no otherwise than a _Skin_ of
_Isinglass_: yet being viewed through a good _Glass_, with a clear and
true Light, and in an advantagious Position; it appears to consist not
only of _Organical Parts_, as do the _Skins_ of _Animals_; but these
also Regularly mixed together; that is, of _Parenchymous_ and _Lignous
Fibres_, all very curiously interwoven as it were, into a piece of
admirably fine white _Sarcenet_: as in _Flag_, _Tulip_, and the like. ♦
_Tab. 48._ ♦

2. §. From hence, it is easy to conceive how the _Skins_ of all
_Plants_, as well as those of _Animals_, are perspirable; _sc._ between
the several _Fibers_ of which they consist. But as the _Skins_ of
_Animals_, especially in some _Parts_, are made with certain open
_Pores_ or _Orifices_, either for the Reception, or the Elimination
of something for the benefit of the _Body_: so likewise the _Skins_,
of at least many _Plants_, are formed with several _Orifices_ or
_Pass-ports_, either for the better _Avolation_ of _Superfluous Sap_,
or the _Admission_ of _Aer_.


3. §. THESE _Orifices_ are not in all _Leaves_ alike; but varied in
_Bigness_, _Number_, _Shape_, and _Position_: Serving to the different
_Nature_ of the _Plant_, or _Leaf_; and giving the _Leaf_, as it were,
a different _Grain_. _Princes Feather_, _i. e._ a Sort of _Sanicle_,
they stand only on the Edges of the _Leaf_; but are very ample. In the
_White Lily_, they are _Oval_, very white, and each surrounded with a
slender white _Border_. They stand about a 6ᵗʰ or 8ᵗʰ part of an Inch
distant, ♦ _Tab. 48._ ♦ as they appear through a good _Glass_, all
over the _Leaf_, but not in any regular Order. These _Orifices_ are
the cause of the Greyish _Gloss_ on the upper side the _Leaf_: for the
Back-side, in which there are none of them, is of a dark _Sea-Green_.

4. §. In the _Leaf_ of _Pine_, they are also _Oval_, and about the same
_Bigness_ and _Number_, as in that of a _Lily_; yet without a Border. ♦
_Tab. 48._ ♦ But their _Position_ is very Elegant, standing all, most
exactly, in _Rank_ and _File_ from one end of the _Leaf_ to the other.


5. §. NEXT TO the _Skin_, lies the _Pulpy_ part of the _Leaf_; which
by the same latitude, as _Use_ hath taught us in many other Words, I
call the _Parenchyma_. This _Parenchyma_ or _Pulp_ of the _Leaf_, like
the _Pith_, and all other _Parenchymous Parts_ of a _Plant_ is made up
of incomparably small _Cylindrick Fibres_: and these _Fibres_, in most
_Leaves_, woven and woun’d up into little _Bladders_.

6. §. The _Bladders_ are here of several Sizes, as in the _Pith_:
but generally more visible in the _Stalk_, than in the _Body_ of the
_Leaf_. ♦ _Tab. 49._ ♦ Varied, as in the _Pith_, so here, not according
to the _Size_, but the _Nature_ of the _Leaf_. So in _Common Dock_, and
_Moth Mullein_, both Great _Leaves_, they are Small; in _Wild Clary_,
a Lesser _Leaf_, they are very Large. ♦ _Tab. 50._ ♦ In the _Body_ of
the _Leaf_, sometimes the _Sides_ of the greater _Bladders_, are made
up of lesser ones; as in _Borage_.

7. §. In some _Leaves_, these _Parenchymous Fibres_ are all drawn close
up together. In the Former, they are as the _Threds_ in the _Open-work_
of _Bone-Lace_; in These, as the same _Threds_, in the _Cloth-work_.

8. §. The _Pithy Part_, in the _Stalk_, and almost up to the Top of the
chief _Fiber_, in many _Leaves_, is Tubular; even whilst they are yet
Young and Sappy: as in _Sweet Chervil_, _Hemlock_, _Endive_, _Cichory_,
_Lampsana_, _Dandelion_, _Burdock_, _Daisye_, _Scorzonera_, and others.
And sometimes the said _Pithy Part_ is opened into several little
_Pipes_, like so many _Aer-Vessels_, above ⅓ of a Foot long; as in the
_Common Dock_ and the _Little Spurge_, by some called _Wart-Wort_.


9. §. THE _Strings_ of the _Leaf_, or those _Fibres_ which are visible
to the bare Eye, are composed of _Vessels_ of the Two General Kinds,
_sc_, for _Sap_, and for _Aer_. They are joyntly distributed throughout
the _Leaf_: Yet not so, as to run meerly parallel; as in _Animals_,
every _Artery_ hath its _Vein_: but the _Aer-Vessels_ are every where
Inclosed, or as it were _sheathed_ in the _Sap-Vessels_.


10. §. THEIR _Position_ is various and regular, not only in the _Body_
of the _Leaf_, as is above shewed; but likewise in the _Stalk_: of
which also I have given several Instances in the _First_ =Book=. I
shall here note, and more particularly describe, One or Two more. In
the _Stalk_ of a _Mallow-Leaf_, they stand in Six Oblong _Parcels_ of
equal Size, and in a _Ring_ near the Circuit. ♦ _Tab. 49._ ♦ Whereby
the _Stalk_ is stronger, the Growth hereof, before and behind, more
equal, and so the posture of the _Leaf_ more erect.

11. §. In _Dandelyon_, they stand in _Five Parcels_: of which the
Greater stands a little _behind_ the Centre of the _Stalk_; figured
into a very small _Half-Moon_ or _Semi-Tube_, whose _Diametre_, through
a _Glass_, is not above ⅛ᵗʰ of an Inch. The other Four, are extream
small _Cylinders_. Altogether make an _Angle_, twice as big as that of
a V Consonant. ♦ _Tab. 49._ ♦ Whereby, although the _Stalk_ be strong
enough to support the younger _Leaves_; yet those which are grown
longer, and so not only by their _Bulk_, but their farther Extension
from the Center of _Gravity_, are become more weighty; commonly lie
flat on the Ground.

12. §. In _Wild Clary_, they stand also in _Five Parcels_, the Greater
stands not _behind_, but _before_ the _Center_; making an _Arch_,
whose _Chord_ in a _Glass_, is above ½ an Inch long; and belongeth
to a _Circle_, whose _Diameter_ is an Inch and half. ♦ _Tab. 49._ ♦
The other Four, are small _Cylinders_, also different from those in
_Dandelion_; the two bigger, there standing hindmost; but here, the two
Less, and the two Bigger, within the two round _Ridges_ of the _Stalk_.

13. §. From hence it is, that the _Leaves_ of this _Plant_ have not
only a _Prone_ or _Horizontal Posture_, but also make that _Forceable
Pressure_ on the Ground, which can by no means be imputed to their
_Weight_. For the _Great Arched-Fibre_ standing before the _Centre_
of the _Stalk_, and the two Longer Round ones being uppermost, in the
_Ridges_ of the _Stalk_; they put on the upper parts thereof to a more
full and forward Growth, and so to bow the _Leaf_ back-ward. And the
_Fibrous Arch_ being, though broad, yet almost flat, doth hereby the
more easily yield to that _Motion_.

14. §. In _Borage_, and _Moth-Mullen_, they stand also in _Five
Parcels_. ♦ _Tab. 49._ ♦ In the former, the largest maketh still a more
bulky _Arch_, than that of _Clary_; being thicker, as broad, and of a
lesser _Circle_ or more bowed. But in _Mullein_, it maketh almost an
entire Oval.

15. §. By means of this _Figuration_, a sufficient number of _Vessels_
for such large _Leaves_, are not only more conveniently Distributed
into them; but also stand more safely in the _Stalk_. For were the
_Arch_ contracted into a _solid Cylinder_, it could not so presently
be resolved into small _Fibers_. And were it laid into a flat _Plate_,
or straight out, either the _Figure_ of the _Stalk_, and so of the
_Leaf_, must be altered; or else, the two ends of the _Plate_, would
come too near the Circumference of the _Stalk_, and so be more liable
to the _Impressions_ of the _Weather_: as may be observed in cutting
the _Stalk_ transversly, and by the _Figures_.


16. §. IN the _Body_ of the _Leaf_, besides the _Positions_ of the
_Fibrous Strings_ or _Threds_; above expressed, there is one _Thred_,
bigger or less, which in all _Plants_, runs round the Edge of the
_Leaf_, and hems in all the rest; but can hardly be well observed in
any, without stripping off the _Skin_ of the _Leaf_. ♦ _Tab. 50._ ♦
When the _Fibres_ of the _Leaf_, are bigger, or less tender, as in
_Holly_, the _Skin_ and the _Pulp_ are sometimes found either rotted
off, or eaten away with _Insects_; whereby, both the said surrounding
_Fiber_, and the rest, are all very fairly visible.


17. §. THE _Vessels_ seem to be continu’d, in the _Leaf_, by being
Ramified out of Greater into Less, as _Veins_ or _Arteries_ are in
_Animals_. But if the _Skin_ and _Pulp_ of the _Leaf_, as suppose a
_Borage-Leaf_ be taken off, and the _Vessels_ laid bare; by the help
of a good _Glass_, it will appear; That they are all of the same Size,
every where in the _Leaf_; ♦ _Tab. 50._ ♦ and also continued throughout
the same, all several and distinct _Pipes_ one from another, as the
_Threds_ in a _Skein_ of _Silk_. And that therefore the _Distribution_
of the _Threds_ which the _Vessels_ compose, is not the Ramifying
of Greater _Pipes_ into Less; but the dividing a greater Cluster of
_Pipes_, into several lesser Clusters, till at last they come to be
single; as in the _Distribution_ of the _Nerves_.

18. §. The _Vessels_ seem also to be Inosculated, not only side to
side, but the ends of some into the Sides of others. But neither is
this ever really done: ♦ _Tab. 50._ ♦ the lesser _Threds_, being only
so far diducted, as sometimes to stand at _Right-Angles_ with the
greater. So that they are Inosculated only End to End or Mouth to
Mouth, after they are come at last to their final distribution.

19. §. The _Aer-Vessels_, are not only, as is said, Existent in the
_Leaves_ of all _Plants_; but are herein also discoverable without the
help of _Glasses_: For upon breaking the _Stalk_ or chief _Fibers_
of a _Leaf_; the likeness of a fine _Woolly_ Substance, or rather of
curious small _Cobwebs_, may be seen to hang at both the broken Ends.
This is taken notice of, only in some few _Plants_, as in _Scabious_,
where it is more visible. ♦ _Tab. 51, & 52._ ♦ But may also be seen
more or less, in most other _Plants_, if the _Leaves_ be very tenderly
broken: as I have noted near twenty years since; and thence conjectur’d
them a Sort of _Vessel_ common to _Plants_. Now this fine _Wool_, is
really a _Skein_ of _Aer-Vessels_, or rather of the _Fibers_ of the
_Aer-Vessels_, unroaved from their _Spiral Position_, and so drawn out
in Length. As they appear thus unroaved and drawn out at Length, both
to the bare Eye, and through a good _Microscope_, I have represented in
two Examples, the one a _Scabious Leaf_, the other that of a _Vine_.


20. §. THE _Weftage_ of the _Strings_ and _Parenchymous Fibers_
together, is here made in the same manner, as hath been described in
the _Anatomy_ of the _Root_, and _Trunk_: the former being in some Sort
as the _Warp_, the latter as the _Woof_ of the _Leaf_.

21. §. And one Example we have (it may be more than one) wherein
Nature shews, though not a greater, yet a different _Art_; and that
is the _Palm-Net_. For whereas in other _Plants_, the _Webb_ is made
betwixt the _Lignous-Strings_ and the _Fibers_ of the _Parenchyma_,
only visible through a _Microscope_: here the said _Strings_ themselves
are Interwoven, and the _Weftage_ apparent to the bare Eye. Of these
_Palm-Nets_ or _Sacks_, there are several Sorts. One of them is
composed in this manner. It hath a Fivefold _Series_ of _Lignous
Strings_ or _Fibers_. The greatest whereof swell out above the rest;
and like so many _Ribs_, are obliquely produced on both hands, so as
to encompass the _Sack_. Along each of these _Ribs_, on the inside the
_Sack_, runs a small _Whitish Line_; being a _Thread_ of _Aer-Vessels_
growing thereto. Betwixt these _Ribs_ or larger _Strings_, there are
others much less, Two or Three betwixt _Rib_ and _Rib_, _Parallelly_
interjected. On the inside, there is a Third _Series_, which is
also obliquely produced; but transversly to the former. The Fourth
and Fifth, consist of the smallest _Strings_; not only Transversly
produced, but also Alternately, from the outside to the inside of
the _Sack_, _& vice versa_. By these two last, all the rest are most
elaborately woven into one entire and strong piece of Work.




                                CHAP. V.

        _Of the_ Duration _of_ Leaves, _and the_ Time _of their_
                               Generation.


AN _Evergreen_, is one degree above a _Plant_ which is simply
_Perennial_: of This, only the _Trunk_ and _Buds_ live all the
_Winter_; of That, also the Expanded _Leaves_. And an _Evergrow_, is a
degree above an _Evergreen_: here, the _Buds_ and young _Sprigs_, do
only _live_; there, they _grow_ and are put forth.

2. §. An _Evergreen_, is made such, either by the _Toughness_ of the
_Skin_, and _Closeness_ or _Density_ of the _Parenchyma_, whereby
the _Leaf_ is better able to endure Cold; as in _Holly_: or by the
extream _Smalness_ or _Fewness_ of the _Aer-Vessels_, whereby the
_Sap_ is less dryed up, and so sufficient, even in _Winter_, for the
Nourishment of the _Leaf_; as in _Box_, and _Yew_, as also _Fir_, and
all _Resiniferous Plants_.

3. §. The perpetual Growth of a _Plant_, seemeth to depend chiefly
on the Nature of the _Sap_. For all _Juyces_ will not ferment alike,
nor with the same degree of _Heat_. So that whereas many _Plants_
require a greater _Heat_, as that of _Summer_, for the fermenting and
distribution of their _Juyces_, and so their growth; the _Warmth_ of
_Spring_ is sufficient for many others; and for some few, that of
_Winter_ it self.


4. §. AS TO the _Time_ wherein the _Leaves_ are formed; First, it is
very probable, That in those _Plants_ which have _Leaves_ (besides the
_Dissimilar_) of Two distinct _Figures_, as hath the Little Common
_Bell_, and some others; the _Under-Leaves_, which differ in Shape
from the rest, are all at first formed in the _Plume_, before it begins
to _sprout_; and the rest afterwards; That is to say, that the former
_Leaves_, are all formed (out of _Sap_ from the _Trunk_) with the
_Seed_ it self, and so compose one Principal _Part_ thereof, _sc._ the
_Plume_: the latter, not till after the _Seed_ is sow’n, and so the
_Plume_ supply’d with _Sap_ immediately from the _Root_. Which _Sap_,
it seems, is so far different from the former, as sometimes to produce
a different Sort of _Leaves_.


5. §. SECONDLY, of the _Buds_ of all _Trees_, and of _Perenni-Stalks_,
it appears, That they consist of a great number of _Leaves_, all
perfectly formed to the Centre; where, notwithstanding, they are
sometimes, not half so big as a _Cheese-Mite_. So that all the _Leaves_
which stand upon a _Branch_ or _Cien_ of one whole Years Growth, were
actually existent in the _Bud_. It is also very observable, That
although these _Buds_ begin to be expanded not till _Spring_, yet
are they entirely Formed, as to all their _Integral Parts_, in the
_Autumn_ foregoing. So that the whole Stock of _Leaves_ which grow upon
a _Tree_, or any _Perennial Stalk_, this year; were made, or actually
in being, the last year. A greater _Heat_, more subtilized _Aer_, and
better concocted _Juyce_, being requisite for their _Generation_, than
for their bare _Expansion_ and _Growth_.


6. §. LASTLY, of all _Annual Plants_, in which there are several
Successive _Generations_ of _Buds_, one under another in one year;
although I have not made the Remarque, yet am apt to believe, That
as the _Leaves_ in every _Bud_ are all formed together, as in other
_Plants_: so likewise, that the Successive _Generations_ of the
_Under-Buds_, begin at certain stated _Terms_: as in some _Plants_, at
every _New Moon_; in others, at the _Full Moon_; and in some perhaps;
with both, or every Fourt’night.




                                CHAP. VI.

  _Of the_ Manner _of the_ Generation _of the_ Leaf. _Where also,
     that of the_ Two General Parts _of a_ Plant, _sc. the_ Lignous
     _and_ Parenchymous, _is further explain’d._


THE _Visible Causes_ of the _Figures_ of _Leaves_, have been formerly
mentioned. ♦ _B. 1. Ch. 4._ ♦ It may here be further noted, That the
greater _Fibers_ of the _Leaf_, being never Braced in the _Stalk_; it
is a good preparative for their better spreading in the _Leaf_. As
also, that the same is much favour’d, by the extream smalness of the
_Aer-Vessels_ herein: whereby they are more easily divaricated, in the
lesser _Fibers_, and so the _Leaf_ dilated.


2. §. BUT these and the like are to be reckoned a secondary _Order_
of _Causes_; which serve rather to carry on and improve, that which
_Nature_ hath once begun. ♦ _Idea, §. 53._ ♦ And therefore, we must
not only consider the visible _Mechanism_ of the _Parts_; but also the
_Principles_ of which they are composed; wherewith, Nature seems to
draw her first _Strokes_.

3. §. Now of these, I have formerly, and as I conceive upon good
ground, supposed, the chief Governing _Principle_, to be the _Saline_,
whether _Alkaline_, _Acid_, or of any other Kind: ♦ _Lib. 2. P. 2. §.
31,_ &c. ♦ being in some sort as the _Mold_ of a _Button_, to which the
other _Principles_, as its _Attire_, do all conform. Or the _Salts_
are, as it were, the _Bones_; the other _Principles_, as the _Flesh_
which covers them.

4. §. A further Argument hereof may be deduced from the _Cuticular_
and other _Concretions_, commonly called _Mothers_, in Distill’d
_Waters_, _Vinegar_, and other _Liquors_. For in these _Concretions_,
there is always a tendence to _Vegetation_; and many of them are
true _Vegetables_ in their Kind; as shall hereafter be seen. Now the
_Liquors_, in which these are generated, do always, wholly or in part,
lose their _Tast_ and _Smell_, and so become _Vapid_. The more sensible
_Principles_ therein having made their _Transit_ from the _Fluid_,
into the _Concrete Parts_. So, I have known, sometimes, _Vinegar_ it
self, to become by these _Concretions_, almost as _Tastless_ as Common
_Water_. Whereby it seems evident, That of _Vegetable Principles_,
there are some, more Masterly than others: and that of these, the
_Saline_ is the chief. The same is likewise argued, from the frequent
Experiment of many good Husband-men; that most _Bodies_ which abound
with _Salt_, are the greatest _Nourishers_ of _Plants_.

5. §. This _Saline Principle_, as is above hinted, is to be understood,
a _Generik_ Name, under which divers _Species_ are comprehended; and
of some whereof, it is always compounded, as in other _Bodies_, so
in _Plants_. As shall be made to appear, by divers Experiments, when
we come, hereafter, to speak of _Vegetable Salts_. Whereby we are
conducted, yet further to enquire, What are the _Principles_ of this
_Principle_?


6. §. NOW these seem to be Four; a _Nitrous_, an _Acid_, an _Alkaline_,
and a _Marine_. The _Admixture_ of the First, is argu’d from the
Place, which Nature hath assigned for the _Generation_ and _Growth_
of most _Plants_, _sc._ neither in _Caverns_ under Ground, as for
_Minerals_; nor above it, as for _Animals_; but the Surface of the
Earth, where this Sort of _Salt_ is copiously bred. And doth therefore
prove, not only a _Mixture_, but a good Proportion hereof with the
other _Principles_ of a _Plant_. Hence it is, that _Dew_ or _Water_ on
_Windows_ or Plain and Smooth _Tables_, by virtue of a _Nitro-Aerial
Salt_, is often frozen into the resemblance of little _Shrubs_. And the
like _Figure_ I have often seen in a well filtred _Solution_ of the
_Salt_ of any of our _Purging Waters_, as of _Epsom_, &c. being set to
_shoot_. Produced, as I conceive, by the _Nitre_, which with the _Rain_
or other _Waters_, is washed down from the _Surface_ of the _Earth_,
and so mixed with the _Mineral Salts_.

7. §. The other Three _Salts_ are exhibited, by the several ways
of Resolving the _Principles_ of a _Plant_. Many _Plants_, even in
their _Natural Estate_, do yield an _Acid Juyce_. And the _Juyces_
of many more, by _Fermentation_, will become _Acid_. And most, by
_Distillation_ in a _Sand-Furnace_, yield an _Acid Liquor_.

8. §. By _Calcination_, all Sorts of _Plants_, yield more or less, both
of a _Fixed_ and a _Volatile Alkaly_: the former, in the _Ashes_; the
latter, in the _Soot_. And, at least the generality, by _Fermentation_
also, yield a _Volatile_ one; or such a kind of _Salt_, which, whether
we call an _Urinous_, or otherwise, hath the like _Odour_ and _Tast_
with that of _Urine_, _Harts-Horn_, _Soot_, and the like.

9. §. The _Marine_, is obtained no other way, that I know of, but from
a Solution of the _Alkaline_, upon its being exposed to the _Aer_.
The process wherof, I shall particularly set down in a following
_Discourse_. Of these _Salts_, mixed in a certain proportion, together,
and also Impregnated with some of the other _Active Principles_ of a
_Plant_, and not without an _Admixture_ of some _Parts_ from the _Aer_;
I suppose, that which I call the _Essential_, is produced: of which, I
shall also give an account in the same _Discourse_.


10. §. ALL THE Four _Salts_ above mentioned, seem in their _Order_,
to have a share in the _Formation_ of a _Leaf_, or other _Part_ of
a _Plant_: And first of all, the _Marine_. For all _Generations_
are made in some _Fluid_: But in every _Fluid_ there is a perpetual
_Intestive Motion_ of _Parts_. So that the first Intention of _Nature_
is, That some of those _Parts_ be disposed to _Rest_. Now of all the
_Principles_ of a _Plant_, there are none hereunto more disposed, than
their _Salts_; whose _Particles_, being figu’rd with plain Sides,
as often as they touch Side to Side, like two _Marbles_ exquisitely
polished, they will adhere together. And the _Particles_ of _Marine
Salt_, being _Cubick_; and so, with respect to their _Figure_, of
greater _Bulk_ than those of any other _Salt_; they will hereby, be
most and first of all disposed to _Rest_; and so become, as it were,
the Foundation of the following _Superstructure_.


11. §. THE Second Intention of Nature is, That the _Particles_ be
brought to _Rest_, in a certain _Position_, agreeable to the _Figure_
of the _Parts_ which are to be formed. And therefore in the next place,
all those _Parts_ of a _Plant_ which are truly _Lignous_, by the
_Marine Salt_, with the assistance of the _Alkaline_, but especially of
the _Nitrous_, are made to shoot out in Length, or into an innumerable
company of small _Cylindrick Fibres_: ♦ _Tab. 53._ ♦ these _Salts_
being, altogether, sturdy enough to resist those _Impulses_ which might
incline them to conform to any other _Figure_.


12. §. THE next Intention is, That these _Fibres_, at the same time
in which they are formed, may likewise receive such a _Posture_ as
will best answer the indented _Shape_ of the _Leaf_. Which _Posture_,
although in the _Growth_ of the _Leaf_ it is much Govern’d by the
_Aer-Vessels_; yet in the _Generation_ hereof, seems to be first
determined by the forementioned _Salts_, according to their several
_Angles_, whereby they are differently applicable one to another.

13. §. Now all the _Sides_ of the _Marine Salt_, and the _Sides_ and
the _Ends_ of the _Nitrous_, properly so called, stand at _Right
Angles_. And it is very probable, from the _Figure_ of the _Crystalls_
in _Spirit_ of _Blood_, and some other _Bodies_, that the _Particles_
of the _Alkaline_ are Square at one End, and Poynted at the other. ♦
_Tab. 53._ ♦ And those of the _Acid_, at both; And that, withal, they
are Shorter and more Slender.

14. §. It should therefore seem, That where the _Alkaline Salt_ is any
way predominant, and that the _Particles_ thereof are placed End to
End; there the _Lignous Fibres_ (as the larger ones in many _Leaves_)
♦ _Tab. 53._ ♦ declining their parallel _Growth_, begin to shoot out
obliquely, or at _Angles_ one with another, and those _Acute_.

15. §. If the same _Salt_ be predominant, and some of its _Particles_
placed, with the Pointed End of one, to the Side of another, ♦ _Tab.
53._ ♦ or the Square End of one, to the Poynted End of another; there
the said _Fibres_ begin to shoot at _Angles_ less _Acute_.

16. §. But if either the _Marine_ or _Nitrous Salt_ is predominant; or
some _Particles_ of the _Alkaline_, are placed with the Square End of
one, to the Side of another; ♦ _Tab. 53._ ♦ there the _Fibres_ begin to
make, not _Acute_, but _Right Angles_; as do the greater _Fibres_, in
some _Leaves_; and the smaller, in all.


17. §. IN the same manner, the _Fibre_ in the Circumference of the
_Leaf_ is also governed; the _Particles_ of the said _Salt_, being
reduceable, not only to any _Angle_, but also to any _Circle_, or
other _Crooked Line_, as they are variously applyed. For if the _major
part_ be applied End to End, and only every Third or Fourth applied
End to Side, they produce a great _Circle_. ♦ _Tab. 53._ ♦ But if the
Poynted End of each, be set to the Side of another, they make a less.
And if the Application be the same, but to the contrary Side, they
thence begin a new _Circle_ with the same _Diameter_, but with another
_Center_, answerable to the intended _Shape_ of the _Leaf_.


18. §. AFTER the same manner, the _Aer-Vessels_ may be formed by the
_Particles_ of the _Acid Salt_. Which, without being supposed to be
crooked (as those of the _Aer_, at least the compounded ones, probably
be) only by applying the lesser Side of one, to the greater Side of
another, will also be reduced to any either _Circular_ or _Spiral
Line_. ♦ _Tab. 53._ ♦ And so, likewise, for the production of the
winding _Fibres_, which compose the _Bladders_ of the _Pith_ and other
_Parenchymous Parts_ of a _Plant_.

19. §. Thus doth _Nature_ every where γεωμετρεῖν. For what She appears
in Her _Works_, She must needs be also in their _Causes_.

                                PART II.




                                CHAP. I.

                          _Of the EMPALEMENT._


I NEXT proceed to the _Flower_. Where I intend not to repeat those
things, which have been by Me already noted in the _First_ =Book=. ♦
_Ch. 5._ ♦ And the foregoing Discourse of _Leaves_, will excuse me
from divers particulars, common to _These_ and the _Flower_. I shall
here therefore remarque some things not before mentioned, or but _in
transitu_, and such as are more particular to the _Flower_.

2. §. And First, it may be noted; That where the _Leaves_ of the
_Flower_ are few; those of the _Empalement_ or _Green Border_, are
either of the same Number, or just half as many, whether even, or odd.
So in _Leucanthenum_ and _Chickweed_, there are Five _Leaves_; in the
former Five _Empalers_; in the latter, Ten. In Great _Celandine_, there
are Four _Leaves_, and but Two _Empalers_; and so in _Poppy_. The
_Arithmetick_ of _Nature_ being every where suitable to Her _Geometry_.

3. §. Of this _Part_ of the _Flower_ it is likewise observable, That it
is rarely, if ever, entire or one piece, but parted into divers little
_Leafy Pales_, especially in all _Flowers_ with the _Florid Attire_,
as of _Marigold_, _Daisy_ and the like; being so numerous, as to make
a _Double_, and often a _Treble_, _Quadruple_ or _Quintuple Border_.
Whereby they are aptly designed, not only to _protect_ the _Leaves_
of the _Flower_ in the _Bud_; and after their Expansion, to keep them
tite: but also, by receding, _Bredthways_, one from another, and so
making a greater _Circle_, gradually to give way for the full Growth
and safe spreading of the _Attire_. Which, in regard it consists of
_Parts_ so exquisitely tender, were it pinched up too close, would be
killed or spoyled before it came to the _Birth_. As _Teeming Women_,
gradually slaken their _Laces_; or as _Taylors_ use to split their
_Stomachers_ into several _Lappets_, to spread, as their _Belly_ rises.

4. §. Nor is the _Posture_ of the _Parts_ in the _Empalement_ less
suitable: not being filed one just over another, but alternately.
Whereby the _Pales_ or _Pannicles_ of every _Under-Order_, serve
to stop up the gaps made by the _Recess_ of the _Upper_. And so,
notwithstanding they all make more roome, yet all conspire to keep the
_Aer_ out.

5. §. It is also worth the notice, That, for the same purpose, the
Edges at least, of the several _Pales_, are neither _Fibrous_,
nor _Pulpy_; but so many extream fine transparent _Skins_, as in
_Chamemile_. Whereby they close so exactly one over another, that it
is impossible for any _Aer_ to creep in, or any _Steams_ useful to the
_Attire_ or _Seed_, over hastily to perspire. As we use, when we have
put a _Cork_ into a _Bottle_, to tie a _Bladder_ over it.




                                CHAP. II.

                           _Of the FOLIATURE._


♦ _Tab. 54._ ♦ THE _Leaves_ of the _Flower_ are folded up in such Sort,
as is most agreeable to their own _Shape_, and that of their inclosed
_Attire_: ♦ _Ch. 5._ ♦ whereof I have given Instances in the _First_
=Book=. I shall here add some further _Remarques_.

2. §. The _Leaves_ of the _Flower_ of _Blattaria_, although of
different _Size_ and _Shape_; ♦ _Tab. 54._ ♦ are so lapped one over
another, as to make an _Equilateral Pentangle_.

3. §. The _Spiral Fold_, which is proper to the _Flower_, and never
seen in the _Green Leaves_; ♦ _Tab. 54._ ♦ as it is it self immediately
visible on the _Surface_, so by cutting off the top of the _Flower_
before it is expanded, seems also to make a _Helix_; as in _Perwincle_,
the larger _Convolvulus_, &c.

4. §. In some _Flowers_, where the _Attire_ is lofty or spreading, as
in _Holioak_, together with the _Spiral Fold_, the _Leaves_ are all at
the top tacked down a little; thereby making a blunter _Cone_, and so a
more ample _Pyramid_ for the inclosed _Attire_.

5. §. In _Poppy_, although the _Leaves_ are extraordinary broad, yet
being but few, and inclosing a small _Attire_; they could not be well
reduced to any regular _Fold_, ♦ _Tab. 54._ ♦ without leaving such a
_Vacuity_, as by being filled with _Aer_, might be prejudicial to the
_Seed_. For which reason, they are cramb’d up within the _Empalement_
by hundreds of little _Wrinckles_ or _Puckers_; as if Three or Four
fine _Cambrick Handcherchiefs_ were thrust into ones _Pocket_.

6. §. In _Ladies-Bower_, the _Leaves_ are neither laped one over
another, as is most usual, nor set Edge to Edge, as sometimes, but
Side to Side, ♦ _Tab. 54._ ♦ answerable to their _Shape_, and the
_Distribution_ of their _Fibres_. Their broad _Tops_ being also rowled
up so as to make a _Cone_. In _Ladys-Looking-Glass_, they stand also
Side to Side, but in a different manner: in the Former with the Sides
standing inward, but here, bearing outward.

7. §. In the _Marvel_ of _Peru_, the _Fold_ is likewise very peculiar.
For, besides the several _Plates_, about Six, ♦ _Tab. 54._ ♦ whereby
the _Flower_ is gathered in the Midle; the _Top_ of it is also gathered
up by as many distinct _Plates_, underneath the former; and these
_rowled_ or _wreathed_ up together so exactly, that the like could
hardly be imitated by a very _dextrous Hand_.


8. §. OF the _Hairs_ upon _Flowers_ and their _Use_ to the _Attire_,
I have also spoken in the _First_ =Book=. ♦ _Ch. 5._ ♦ I shall here
add, That they are likewise of _Use_ to the _Leaves_ themselves,
that is, for their closer and faster _Conjunction_. For of some
_Flowers_ it is observable, That they are all over _smooth_, saving
on their Edges, which are border’d with _Fringes_ of _Hair_; as of
_Spanish Broome_, _Dulcamara_, and others: ♦ _Tab. 55._ ♦ In which,
the _Hairs_ on the Edge of one _Leaf_, are so complicated, or at
least indented, with those of another, that all the _Leaves_ seem to
be but one piece. _Nature_ seeing it fit, by this means to tie them
together, lest they should be expanded before it be due time.

9. §. Many _Flowers_ instead of _Hairs_, are beset round about, with
a great Number of small _Parts_, not ending in a _Poynt_, but having
a _Head_. Sometimes oval, as in _Snap-Dragon_, like the _Horns_ of a
_Butterfly_, or a _Plummers Sodering-Iron_. But usually _Globular_, as
in _Deadly Nightshade_, like so many little _Mushrooms_ sprouting out
of the _Flower_.

10. §. Out of these _Heads_, doth sometimes issue a _Gummy_ or
_Balsamick Juyce_. From whence proceeds that _Clamminess_ of some
_Flowers_, whereby, being handled they stick to our _Fingers_, as do
those of _Blattaria_, and of _Marigold_; and those of _Colus Jovis_,
where the said _Heads_ are so _soft_ and _succulent_, that they
resemble so many little _Drops_ of _Balsame_. The _Clamminess_ which is
felt upon fresh _Carduus_, may perhaps proceed from the like _Cause_.


11. §. THE _Number_ of the _Leaves_ of the _Flower_ hath been noted
by the Learned Sir _Thomas Brown_, ♦ Treat. of the _Quinc_. ♦ to be
usually _Five_. And this Nature so far affecteth, that many times where
the _Leaves_ of the same _Flower_ are of a different _Size_, yet they
keep to this _Number_, ♦ _Tab. 54._ ♦ as in _Blattaria_.

12. §. I also add, That even those _Flowers_, which are not properly
parted into _Leaves_, have yet their _Tops_ usually divided into
_Five_ great _Scallops_; as those of _Toad-Flax_, _Snap-Dragon_,
_Coded-Arsmart_, _Clary_, _Broom_, and others. And when the _Flower_
hath more than _Five_, even many times _Five Leaves_; yet the _Top_
of each _Leaf_ is indented into _Five Parts_; ♦ _Tab. 54._ ♦ as in
_Scorzonera_, _Cichory_, and all the _Intybous_ Kind, with many others.

13. §. From whence and other like _Instances_, it may seem, That there
is some certain _Species_ of _Salt_ in _Nature_, and that in most
_Plants_, of whose _Agency_ there are still some _Footsteps_ or other
in the _Flower_.

14. §. The _Number_ of the _Leaves_, as hath been said, is commonly
_Five_. Yet some _Flowers_ have fewer, and some more, and that with
Constancy, in divers _Numbers_, from _One_ to _One_ and _Twenty_;
perhaps in all, so far. The _Flower_ of _Acanthus Syriacus_, is in
a manner one single _Leaf_, that of _Monks-Rubarb_, _Three-Leav’d_;
of _Poppy_, _Crosswort_, _Radish_, and many others, _Four-Leav’d_;
the greater _Number_ of _Flowers_, _Five-Leav’d_; of _White
Hellebore_, _Tulip_, _Onion_, and most _Plants_ with _Bulbous Roots_,
_Six-Leav’d_; of _Wild-Crowfoot_, _Seven-Leav’d_; of _French Marigold_,
commonly _Eight-Leav’d_; of _Flower-de-luce_, _Nine-Leav’d_; of
_Chickweed_, _Ladies-Mantle_, _Ten-Leav’d_; of _St. James’s Wort_,
_Thirteen-Leav’d_; and I think of _Febrifuga_, _Cotula_, _Ageratum_,
_Corn-Marigold_, with others; and of _Chamemile_, _Buphthalmum_, and
some few more, the _Leaves_ are commonly _One_ and _Twenty_. In that of
St. _James’s Wort_, the _Number_ is so constant that there is scarce
_One Flower_ in _Forty_, wherein the _Leaves_ are more or fewer than
_Thirteen_. ♦ _Tab. 55._ ♦ Divers of which _Numbers_, seem also to have
some relation to the _Number_ 5. For 9, is Twice; 13, Thrice; and 25,
Five times 5 running into it self.


15. §. THE _Constituent Parts_ of the _Flower_ are the same as those of
the _Leaf_, _sc._ the _Parenchyma_ or _Pulp_, and the _Vessels_. But
in the _Basis_ or bottom of the _Flower_, the _Parenchyma_ is commonly
much more _spongy_ and _dry_, than in the _Leaves_; conteining,
after the _Flower_ is open’d, little or no _Sap_, but only a dry and
warm _Aer_. Which standing continually under the _Seed_, hastens the
_Maturation_ or due _Exiccation_ thereof: as we use to dry _Maulted
Barly_ over a warm _Killn_.

16. §. The _Vessels_ of the _Flower_, are both for _Sap_ and for _Aer_,
as well as in other _Parts_. And both of them sometimes, even in the
_Skin_ of the _Flower_; as may be argued from its being stained with
divers _Colours_; produced as hath formerly been shewed, by the mixed
_Tinctures_ of the said _Vessels_. ♦ _B. 2. P. 2. §. 65, 66, 67._ ♦
These _Colours_, in many _Flowers_, as _Tulips_, as they are in the
_Skin_ it self, so therein only; the _Pulp_ of the _Leaf_ being white.

17. §. The _Lignous_ or _Sap-Vessels_ are fewer, and the _Aer-Vessels_
smaller in the _Flower_, than in the _Leaf_. And therefore it is
very difficult to observe the latter by _Glasses_; especially the
_Proportion_ which they hold to the other _Parts_. But if you break
the _Leaves_ of some _Flowers_, with very great gentleness; they may
hereby be _Unroaved_ or _drawn out_, as in the _Green Leaves_, to some
visible length; and their different _Number_ in divers _Flowers_ may be
discerned.


18. §. THE _Use_ of the _Flower_ or of the _Foliature_ whereof we
are speaking, is various; ♦ _B. 1. Ch. 5._ ♦ as hath formerly been
shewed. I now only add, That one _Use_ hereof seemeth to be, for
the _Separation_ of the more _Volatile_ and stronger _Sulphur_ of
the _Plant_. That so the _Seed_, which lyeth within or next it, may
be so much the milder, and the _Principles_ thereof more fixed and
concentred. And this, both for its better _Duration_ till the time of
_Sowing_; and also, that its _Fermentation_, when it is sow’n, may not
be too hot and precipitate; but suitable to so slow and equal a motion,
as is the _Vegetation_ of a _Seed_.

19. §. And that this _Sulphur_ is separated and discharged by the
_Flower_, seems evident, not only from the _Strength_ of its _Odour_,
above that of the other _Parts_; but likewise, in that many times
where there is no _Flower_, or that very small, the _Seed_, that is
its _Cover_, as in the _Umbelliferous Kind_, is the more odorous. And
therefore also, the _Vine_ hath no _Flower_, partly, that the most
_Volatile Spirit_ and _Sulphur_ might all run into the _Fruit_.


20. §. THE _Figure_ of the _Flower_, although it is often much more
complex, than that of the _Leaf_: yet there is no doubt, but that
the _Measure_ hereof may be defined in some way, answerable to that
exemplified in the foregoing =Part=. The difference is only this,
That whereas the _Green Leaves_, and the Plain _Leaves_ also of the
_Flower_, are all measured by the _parts_ of several _Circles_: those
_Flowers_ which are _Bellyed_, and those _Leaves_ of the _Flower_ which
are not _Plain_, but _Convex_, are all measured by the _parts_ of
several _Spheres_. And as the _Diametres_ of those _Circles_, bear a
certain proportion to the midle _Stemm_ of the _Leaf_; so the _Axes_ of
these _Spheres_, to an imaginary one in the _Centre_ of the _Flower_.


21 §. NOW the reason why the _Figure_ of the _Flower_ is more
_multiplex_, than that of the _Leaf_; may be, _partly_, because it
is under the Command and Government of those _Salts_, which are here
more _refined_ and _depurate_, than in the _Leaf_; and so more free to
lay the Foundation of any kind of _Figure_, for which, of their own
_Nature_, they are adapted. _Partly_, for that as the _Nitrous_ and
_Alkaline Salts_ are chiefly regnant in the _Leaf_; so in the _Flower_,
in which the _Parenchymous Part_ hath a greater[66] proportion than in
the _Leaf_; it is most reasonable, to assign the _Predominion_ to the
_Acid_[67]: the _Particles_ whereof, both as they are less, and also
poynted at both ends,[68] seem to be more easily applicable one to
another for the making of any Sort of _Line_ or _Figure_.

      _Of the_ Attire, _and first of that sort which may be called_
                               Seminiform.


WITHIN the _Foliature_ stands the _Attire_; which is of Two
general _Kinds_, every where Various and Elegant; according to the
_Description_ I have given of them in the _First_ =Book=. ♦ _Ch. 5._ ♦
I shall here add some further _Remarques_.

2. §. And first, of that Sort of _Attire_, which may be called
_Seminiform_; being usually, as it were, a little _Sheaf_ of _Seed-like
Particles_; standing on so many _Pedicills_, as the _Ear_ doth upon the
_End_ of the _Straw_.

3. §. Of their _Colour_ it is observable, That for the most part,
they are _White_ or _Yellow_; sometimes _Blew_; but never _Red_, let
the _Flower_ or _Foliature_ be of what _Colour_ it will. Neither doth
their _Colour_ always follow that of the _Foliature_, although that be
not _Red_. Whereby it appears, how very Curious and Critical _Nature_
is, in the _Separation_ of the _Juyces_ in _Plants_: that such small
_Parts_ as these of the _Attire_, and so near the _Leaves_ of the
_Flower_, should yet receive a different _Tincture_.

4. §. These _Parts_ differ also in their _Position_; standing sometimes
double upon each _Pedicil_, as in _Toad-flax_, _Snapdragon_, and some
others; ♦ _Tab. 55._ ♦ but usually single, as in _Blattaria_, _Clematis
Austriaca_, &c. Sometimes fastned to their _Pedicils_ at their middle,
stooping down after the manner of _Poppy_ and other hanging _Flowers_;
as in _Spanish-Broom_, _Hysop_, _Scabeous_, _Behen_, &c. Sometimes they
stand erected, as in _Clematis Austriaca_, _Ladyes-Looking-Glass_,
_Rape-Crowfoot_, &c. Those of _Coded Arsmart_ have no _Pedicils_, but
stand upon a large _Base_.

5. §. Of the _Pedicils_ themselves, it is to be noted, That they are
rarely fastned to the _Top_ of the _Repository_ or _Case_ of the
_Seed_, but round about the _Bottom_. _Partly_, That hereby they may
the better intercept and separate the _Incongruous Parts_ of the _Sap_
from the _Seed_. Yet in the _Coded Arsmart_ they stand at the _Top_.
Which is not the only thing peculiar in that _Plant_; it being the
property thereof, to ejaculate its _Seed_, upon the least touch. Which
property seemeth to depend, _partly_, upon the _Position_ of the said
_Pedicils_, as shall be shewed in speaking of the _Seed_.

6. §. These _Seed-like Parts_ are also of different _Number_. In _Great
Celandine_, _Rose_, _Rape-Crowfoot_, numerous; in _Great Plantaine_,
and some other _Herbs_, much more conspicuous than the _Foliature_ it
self. In _Germander-Chickweed_, they are always _Two_, and no more.
Sometimes they follow the number of the _Leaves_, especially in the
number 5; as in _Blattaria_, _Black Henbean_, &c. In _Stichwort_ and
_Lychnis Sylvestris_, they are 10, just double to the number of the
_Leaves_.

7. §. They differ also in their _Bigness_, being in some smaller
_Flowers_, large; as in _Borage_, _Ladys-Looking-Glass_, and others:
and in some larger _Flowers_, less; as in the _Rose_.

8. §. But especially in their _Shape_, which is always very Elegant,
and with much Variety. In _Borage_, like the point of a _Spear_. In
_Blattaria_, like a _Horse-shooe_. In _Clematis Austriaca_, like the
_Spatula_, wherewith _Apothecaries_ make their _Mixtures_. In _Mallow_,
like a _Head-Roll_. In _Hysop_, they have one _Cleft_ before; in
_Blattaria_, one round about; in _Water Bettony_, one at the _Top_; in
_Scabious_, they have a double _Cleft_, one on each side; ♦ _Tab. 56._
♦ and so in St. _Johns Wort_, _Hyoscyamus_, and others; before they
open, in the _Shape_ of a double _Purse_.

9. §. These _Parts_, are all hollow; each being the _Theca_ or _Case_
of a great many extream small _Particles_, either _Globular_, or
otherwise _Convex_; but always regularly _figur’d_. They are all
crowded together, and fastned in close _Ranks_, without any _Pedicils_,
to the Insides of the _Theca_, like other lesser _Seeds_ within a
greater; or after the same manner as in _Hyoscyamus_ and some other
_Plants_, the true _Seeds_ themselves grow all round about close to the
_Bed_ of the _Case_; as in _Clary_, and the _Figures_ now referred to,
may be seen. ♦ _Tab. 55, 56._ ♦ And when they are ripe, the _Case_ also
opens and admits them to the _Aer_, as the _Seed-Case_ doth the _Seed_.
The whole _Attire_, together with the _Foliature_ and _Seed-Case_, ♦ _Tab.
57._ ♦ See in one Example, amongst the _Figures_.

10. §. The _Colour_ of these small _Particles_ conteined in the
_Theca_, is also different. But as That is usually _White_ or _Yellow_,
so are These: sometimes _Blewish_; but never _Red_. And sometimes not
of the same _Colour_ with that of the _Theca_. Which further shews how
scrupulous _Nature_ is, in differencing the _Tinctures_ of the several
_Parts_.

11. §. They are also of different _Bigness_ and _Figure_. Those
in _Snap-dragon_, are of the smallest _Size_ I have seen; ♦ _Tab.
58._ ♦ being no bigger through a good _Microscope_, than the least
_Cheese-Mite_ to the naked Eye. In _Plantain_, also through a _Glass_,
like a _Scurvy-grass-seed_. In _Bears-foot_, like a _Mustard-seed_. In
_Carnation_, like a _Turnep-Seed_. In _Bindweed_, like a _Peper-Corn_.
In all these of a _Globular Figure_.

12. §. In _Devils-bit_, they are also _Round_, but depressed, like the
_Seed_ of _Goos-grass_, or a _Holland Cheese_. In the _Bean_ and all
sorts of _Puls_, and _Trefoyls_, as also in _Blew-bottle_, &c. they are
_Cylindrick_. ♦ _Tab. 58._ ♦ In _Orange Lilly_, _Oval_, one 5ᵗʰ of an
Inch long, like an _Ants-Egg_. In _Deadly-Nightshade_, also _Oval_, but
smaller at both Ends. And those of _Pancy_, _Cubick_. In all these and
the former, they are _Smooth_.

13. §. But in _Mallow_, _Holyoak_, and all of that kind, they are
beset round about with little _Thornes_; whereby each looks like the
_Seed-Ball_ of _Roman Nettle_, or like the _Fruit_ of _Thorn-Apple_,
or the _Fish_ called _Piscis orbis minor_, or the _Murices_, used
antiently in _Wars_. ♦ _Tab. 58._ ♦ They are also very great, shewing,
through a _Glass_, of the bigness of a large _White Pease_; being 200
or 300 times biger than those in _Snapdragon_; of which there are about
a _Thousand_ in each _Theca_, that is, in the space of about 1000ᵗʰ
_Cubical Part_ of an Inch.

14. §. In some _Plants_, as in _Deadly Night-shade_, where these
_Particles_ are _White_, they seem, by a very good _Glass_ and
advantagious _Position_, to be composed of _Parenchymous_ and _Lignous
Fibres_, stitched up together, as in the other _Parts_.

15. §. In _Colocynthis_, (and with some _Analogy_ in _Wild Cucumer_,
and I suppose all of that kind) the _Attire_ is very peculiar, not
consisting of several little _Thecæ_, upon so many _Pedicils_, as is
described; but is all one entire _Part_, like a thick _Columna_ in the
midst of the _Flower_; having several little _Ridges_, and _Furrows_
winding from the _Top_ to the _Bottom_ round about. In the midle of
each _Ridge_ runs a _Line_, where the _Skin_, after sometime, openeth
into two _Lips_, presenting the _Globular Particles_ conteined in the
hollow of every _Ridge_.

16. §. Where the _Attire_ consists of several _Seed-like Parts_, as is
described there, another _Part_ distinct, like a little _Columna_ or
_Pinacle_, stands on the _Top_ of the _Uterus_ or true _Seed-Case_.
Which is also regularly and variously _Figured_. In _Bindweed_, it
hath a round _Head_, like that of a great _Pin_. ♦ _Tab. 56, 57._ ♦ In
the _Common Bell_, St. _Johns wort_, it is divided into _Three Parts_.
In _Geranium_, into _Five_; In _Asarum_, into _Six_. Sometimes, the
_Head is Smooth_, and sometimes beset with little _Thorns_, as in
_Hyoscyamus_. Of the _Use_ of these _Parts_, anon.




                                CHAP. IV.

                         _Of the FLORID ATTIRE._

IN THIS _Attire_ there is also much Elegant Variety, according to the
_Description_ we have given of it in the _First_ =Book=. It always
consists of several _Suits_; Ten, Twenty, Fourty, a Hundred, or more,
according to the _Bigness_ of the _Flower_. And every _Suit_ most
commonly, of three distinct _Parts_, all of a Regular, but Different
_Figure_. The utmost Part, is always like a little _Flower_ with Five
_Leaves_ and a _Tubular Base_, like that of _Cowslip_. ♦ _Tab. 59._ ♦
So that every _Flower_ with the _Florid Attire_, Embosomes, or is, a
_Posy_ of perfect _Flowers_.

2. §. In some _Flowers_, every one of these _Florets_, is encompassed
with an _Hedg_ of _Hairs_; and every _Hair_ branched on both sides
almost like a _Sprig_ of _Fir_; ♦ _Tab. 59._ ♦ as in _Aster Atticus_,
_Golden-Rod_, and others.

3. §. The _Base_ of the _Floret_ is usually _Cylindrick_, but sometimes
Square, as in _French Marigold_. And the _Leaves_ hereof which, for
the most part, ♦ _Tab. 60._ ♦ are Smooth on the Inside, in the same
_Flower_ are all over _Hairy_. And the Edges of these little _Flowers_,
are frequently _Ridged_, or as it were, _Hem’d_, like the Edge of a
_Band_.

4. §. The midlemost of the Three _Parts_, which I call the _Sheath_,
♦ _B. 1. Ch. 5._ ♦ is usually fastened towards the _Top_, or else at
the _Bottom_ of the _Floret_. ♦ _Tab. 60, 61, 62._ ♦This is rather
indented, than parted into _Leaves_. The _Surface_ seldom Plain or
Even, but wrought with Five _Ridges_, and as many _Gutters_ running
almost Parallel from the _Top_ to the _Bottom_.

♦ _B. 1. Ch. 5._ ♦ 5. §. The _Inmost Part_, which I call the _Blade_,
runs through the hollow of the Two Former, and so is fastned, with the
_Floret_, to the convex of the _Seed-Case_. The _Head_ and _Sides_ of
this _Part_, is always beset round about with _Globulets_, commonly
through a _Glass_, as big as a _Turnep-seed_, or a great _Pins-Head_.
In some _Plants_ growing close to the _Blade_, as in the common
_Marigold_; ♦ _Tab. 60, 61, 62._ ♦ in the _French_, and others, upon
_Pedicils_ or little slender _Stalks_. These, as the _Blade_ springeth
up from within the _Sheath_, are still rubed off, and so stand like
a _Powder_ on them both. And sometimes, as in _Cichory_, they seem
to grow on the Inside of the _Sheath_, if it be split with a small
_Pin_: as also in _Knapweed_, in which they are numerous. Yet in the
_Seed-like Attire_, always more numerous, than in the _Florid_.

6. §. The _Head_ of the _Blade_ is always divided into _Two_, and
sometimes into _Three Parts_, as in _Cichory_; ♦ _Tab. 58,_ &c. ♦
which, by degrees, curl outward, after the manner of _Scorpion-Grass_.

7. §. The _Description_ now given, agrees principally to the
_Corymbiferous Kind_, as _Tansy_, _Chamemile_, and the like. But in
_Scorzonera_, as also _Cichory_, _Hawk-Weed_, _Mous-ear_ and all the
_Intybous_ Kind, with many more, the _Attire_ is not separate from
the _Foliature_, so as to stand within that in one entire _Posy_; but
every _Leaf_ of the _Flower_ hath its own _Attire_ apart. For the sake
of which, the _Basis_ of every _Leaf_ is formed into a little _Tube_ or
_Pipe_,♦ _Tab. 62._ ♦ whereby it embosomes its own _Attire_ within it
self. Consisting commonly of _Two Parts_, a _Sheath_ and a _Blade_: the
_Leaf_ it self answering to the _Floret_ in other _Flowers_.

8. §. In some _Plants_, besides the _Attire_ or _Posy_ in the midle of
the _Flower_; the _Leaves_ also have each their own to themselves, as
in _Marigold_: ♦ _Tab. 61._ ♦ yet this, as I take it, consisting only
of one single _Part_, which answers to the _Blade_; the _Leaf_ it self
being as the _Sheath_.

9. §. In many _Plants_, this _Florid Attire_ is very large; so that not
only the _Suits_, ♦ _Tab. 61._ ♦ but also the several _Parts_ whereof
every _Suit_ consists, being throughly ripe and well blown open, are
all visible to the bare Eye, as in _Knapweed_, and all the _Thistle
Kind_. This _Attire_ is all the _Flower_, that this sort of _Plants_
have; being, though _Empal’d_, yet without any _Foliature_.

10. §. And sometimes, there is little or no _Flower_ besides this
_Attire_, although extream small, as in _Golden Rod_, _Wormwood_ and
others. Where it may be noted, That the _Medicine_ called _Wormseed_
or _Semen Santonici_, is no Sort of _Seed_, but the _Buds_ of small
_Flowers_, or of the _Florid Attire_ of that _Plant_.




                                CHAP. V.

                      _Of the_ Use _of the_ Attire.


OF the _Secondary Use_ hereof, I have spoken in the _First_ =Book=; ♦
_Ch. 5._ ♦ and particularly, of the _Globulets_ or small _Particles_
within the _Thecæ_ of the _Seed-like Attire_, and upon the _Blades_
of the _Florid_, I have conjectur’d, That they are that _Body_ which
_Bees_ gather and carry upon their _Thighs_, and is commonly called
their _Bread_. For the _Wax_ they carry in little _Flakes_ in their
_Chaps_: but the _Bread_ is a Kind of _Powder_; yet somewhat moist, as
are the said little _Particles_ of the _Attire_.

2. §. But the Primary and chief _Use_ of the _Attire_ is such, as
hath respect to the _Plant_ it self; and so appears to be very great
and necessary. Because, even those _Plants_ which have no _Flower_
or _Foliature_, are yet some way or other _Attir’d_; either with the
_Seminiform_, or the _Florid Attire_. So that it seems to perform its
service to the _Seed_, as the _Foliature_, to the _Fruit_.

3. §. In discourse hereof with our Learned _Savilian_ Professor Sir
_Thomas Millington_, he told me, he conceived, That the _Attire_ doth
serve, as the _Male_, for the _Generation_ of the _Seed_.

4. §. I immediately reply’d, That I was of the same Opinion; and gave
him some reasons for it, and answered some _Objections_, which might
oppose them. But withall, in regard every _Plant_ is ἀῤῥενόθηλυς or
_Male_ and _Female_, that I was also of Opinion, That it serveth for
the _Separation_ of some _Parts_, as well as the _Affusion_ of others.
The sum therefore of my Thoughts concerning this _Matter_, is as
follows.

5. §. And First, it seems, That the _Attire_ serves to discharge
some redundant _Part_ of the _Sap_, as a _Work_ preparatory to the
_Generation_ of the _Seed_. In particular, that as the _Foliature_
serveth to carry off the _Volatile Saline Sulphur_: So the _Attire_, to
minorate and adjust the _Aereal_; to the end, the _Seed_ may become the
more _Oyly_, and its _Principles_, the better fixed. And therefore the
_Foliature_ generally hath a much stronger _Odour_, than the _Attire_:
because the _Saline Sulphur_ is stronger, than an _Aerial_, which is
too subtile to affect the Sense. Hence also it is, that the _Colour_
of the _Parts_ of the _Attire_, is usually _White_, or _Yellow_, never
_Red_: the former, depending upon a greater participation of _Aer_;
the latter, of _Sulphur_. I add further, That the most _Volatile_ and
_Aerial Sulphur_; being by means of these _Parts_ much discharged; it
may hereby come to pass, not only that the _Seed_ is more _Oylie_, and
its _Principles_ more fixed; but also, that the _Body_ or _Parenchyma_
thereof, is so compact and close: For although it consists of
_Bladders_, yet such, as are Twenty times smaller than in any other
_Part_ of a _Plant_ of the like bigness. Whereas, were the _Aer_
copiously mixed with the _Sap_ here, as in the _Pith_, _Fruit_, and
other _Parenchymous Parts_; it would give so quick a _Ferment_ to the
_Sap_, as to dilate and amplify the _Bladders_ of the _Seed_, beyond
its present compact and durable _Texture_; and so expose it, either to
a precipitant _Growth_, or sudden _Rot_. Wherefore, as the _Seed-Case_
is the _Womb_; so the _Attire_ (which always stands upon or round about
it) and those _Parts_ of the _Sap_ hereinto discharged; are, as it
were, the _Menses_ or _Flowers_, by which the _Sap_ in the _Womb_, is
duly qualified, for the approaching _Generation_ of the _Seed_.

6. §. And as the young and early _Attire_ before it opens, answers to
the _Menses_ in the _Female_: so is it probable, that afterward when
it opens or cracks, it performs the _Office_ of the _Male_. This is
hinted from the _Shape_ of the _Parts_. For in the _Florid Attire_, the
_Blade_ doth not unaptly resemble a small _Penis_, with the _Sheath_
upon it, as its _Præputium_. And in the _Seed-like Attire_, the several
_Thecæ_, are like so many little _Testicles_. And the _Globulets_
and other small _Particles_ upon the _Blade_ or _Penis_, and in the
_Thecæ_, are as the _Vegetable Sperme_. Which, so soon as the _Penis_
is exerted, or the _Testicles_ come to break, falls down upon the
_Seed-Case_ or _Womb_, and so Touches it with a _Prolifick_ Virtue.

7. §. _Consentaneous_ hereto it is also observable, That those _Herbs_
generally have the _Seed-like Attire_, which either produce a greater
Quantity of _Seed_, or a _Perennial Root_: and that there is no _Tree_,
with the _Florid Attire_. As if the other, because it contains a far
greater Proportion of the abovesaid _Particles_, that is, of _Sperm_;
’tis able to beget a more _Numerous_, _Vivaceous_, or _Gigantick Birth_.

8. §. That the same _Plant_ is both _Male_ and _Female_, may the
rather be believed, in that _Snails_, and some other _Animals_, are
such. And the _Parts_ which imitate the _Menses_, and the _Sperm_,
are not precisely the same: the former, being the External _Parts_ of
the _Attire_, and the _Sap_, which feeds them; the latter, the small
_Particles_ or moyst _Powder_ which the External inclose.

9. §. And that these _Particles_, only by falling on the _Uterus_,
should communicate to it or to the _Sap_ therein, a _Prolifick Virtue_;
it may seem the more credible, from the manner wherein _Coition_
is made by some _Animals_; as by many _Birds_, where there is no
_Intromission_, but only an _Adosculation_ of _Parts_: And so in many
_Fishes_. Neither in others, doth the _Penis_ ever enter any further
than the _Neck_ of the _Womb_. Nor doth perhaps the _Semen_ it self: or
if it doth, it can by no means be thought, bodily or as to its gross
_Substance_, to enter the _Membranes_, in which every _Conception_, or
the _Liquor_ intended for it, before any _Coition_, is involved; but
only some subtle and _vivisick Effluvia_, to which the visible _Body_
of the _Semen_, is but a _Vehicle_. And the like _Effluvia_ may be very
easily transfused from the above said _Particles_ into the _Seed-Case_
or _Womb_ of a _Plant_.

10. §. If any one shall require the Similitude to hold in every Thing;
he would not have a _Plant_ to resemble, but to be, an _Animal_.




                                CHAP. VI.

           _Of the_ Time _of the_ Generation _of the_ Flower.


THE _Time_ in which the _Flower_ is Generated or Formed is a Providence
in Nature, whereof, I do a little wonder, that no one, amongst so many
observers of _Plants_, hath ever yet taken any notice. It is therefore
to be remarked, That all _Flowers_ are formed or perfectly finished,
in all their _Parts_, long before they appear in sight; usually Three
or Four Months, and sometimes half a year, or more. And that in all
_Perennial Plants_, those _Flowers_ which appear and are called the
_Flowers_ of any one year; are not formed in that year; but were
actually in _Being_, and entirely formed in all _Parts_, the year
before; as in many _Herbs_, and in all _Shrubs_ and _Trees_.

2. §. This will best be seen by some Instances. So the _Flower_ of
_Mezereon_, which opens in _January_, is entirely formed about the
midle of _August_ in the year foregoing. At which time, the _Green
Leaves_ of the _Bud_ being cautiously removed, ♦ _Tab. 63._ ♦ the
_Leaves_ of the _Flower_, and the _Thecæ Seminiformes_ or _Seed-like
Attire_, encompassing the _Seed-Case_, through an indifferent _Glass_,
are all distinctly visible.

3. §. The like may be seen in _Sirynga_, and other _Shrubs_, and in
_Trees_. In as many of which, as are _Frugiferous_, the _Fruit_ also,
which answers to the _Seed-Case_ in other _Plants_, is about the same
time entirely formed.

4. §. And so in _Herbs_; as the _Flower_ of _Asarum_, which appeareth
in _April_ or _May_, is entirely formed in _August_ or _July_ of the
foregoing year. For there are here, as well as in _Trees_, ♦ _Tab. 64._
♦ Two Sorts of _Buds_; some which are composed only of _Green Leaves_;
and some which also contein a _Flower_ and the _Seed-Case_. So in
_Bears-foot_, by some called the _January Rose_, the _Flower-Buds_,
which open in _January_ are all formed in or before the Month of
_August_ in the year preceding.

5. §. The same may also be seen about the end of _August_ or the
beginning of _September_ in a _Tulip-Root_. ♦ _Tab. 63._ ♦ In which,
the Two Inmost _Shells_ dryer than the rest, stand hollow, with the
little young _Flower_ (which appears in _March_ or _April_ following)
inclosed now in their _Centre_. Being thus kept _warm_ and _dry_, lest
it should either perish, or be precipitated upon the _Winter_, by
sprouting too soon.

6. §. From hence it is plain, That although the _Flower_ appears before
the _Seed_; yet if the comparison be made betwixt the _Flower_ and
_Seed_ of the same year; the _Seed_ is first formed, and afterward the
_Flower_. That is, the _Seed_, for which Nature chooses the Firstborn
_Sap_, is formed in the fore part of the year: which work being
finished, out of the less _fœcund part_ of the _Sap_, the _Flowers_
intended for the _Sire_ and _Matrix_ of the next years _Seed_; is
afterwards produced.


7. §. THE true _Time_ of the _Generation_ of the _Flower_ being know’n,
it may also be an Inducement to make Tryal, for the bringing of many
_Flowers_ to grow fairly in _Winter_, which are used to grow, that is,
to appear, only in the _Spring_ and _Summer_: _sc._ by keeping the
_Plants_ warm, and thereby enticing the young lurking _Flowers_ to come
abroad.




                             _The Appendix._

       _Being a_ Method _proposed, for the ready finding, by the_
        Leaf _and_ Flower, _to what Sort any_ Plant _belongeth._


ALTHOUGH many have bestowed extraordinary Care and Industry upon the
searching out, and Description of _Plants_; and for the reducing of
them to their several _Tribes_: yet I will take leave, here to propose
a short _Method_ whereby Learners, seeing a _Plant_ they know not,
may be informed to what Sort it belongs, and so be directed where to
find it described and discoursed of. For, except they have a Master to
conduct them, which few have; they must needs, by seeking at random,
lose a great deal of time, which by a regular Enquiry might be saved.
Besides, that what is learned by their own Observation, will abide much
longer on their mind, than what they are only Poynted to, by another.

2. §. Now the most _Philosophick_ way of distinguishing or sorting of
_Plants_, were by the _Characteristick Properties_ in all _Parts_, both
_Compounded_, _Constituents_, and _Contents_. But of the _Compounded_,
the _Seeds_, and some other _Parts_, are oftentimes very _minute_: and
the _Roots_ always lie hid. As also the _Constituent Parts_, every
where, without cuting and the use of _Glasses_. Nor can the _Contents_
be accurately observed otherwise. So that for the _Use_ here intended,
those _Properties_ are the fitest to be insisted upon, which are the
most _Conspicuous_, and in those _Parts_, where the Learner may the
most readily and without any difficulty take notice of them; as in the
_Flower_ and _Leaf_. The _Flower_ hath Varieties enough of it self.
But in regard it is often wanting, when the _Green Leaf_ is not; it
is therefore convenient, that he be assisted by both, and that the
Varieties of both be distinctly reduced unto _Tables_. Which may be
done, after the following, or some other like manner.

3. §. And First for the _Leaves_. The most obvious _Varieties_ of
which, are in their _Position_, _Size_ or _Shape_.

4. §. _Leaves_ are fastned with, or without a _Stalk_. Without, only
close to the _Branch_, as in _Southistle_; or surrounding it, as in
_Thorow-Wax_.

5. §. Both these ways, they stand either singly, that is, but one at
the same height; or more together.

6. §. More together, in Even or Odd Numbers. In Even Numbers,
commonly Two and Two, as in _Sage_, _Polium_; Sometimes Four, as in
_Cross-wort_, _Madder_, _Herb True-Love_, _Pomum Majæ_; or more, as, I
think, in _Woodrofe_, &c. In Odd Numbers, Three, as in all _Trefoyls_,
_Strawberries_; Five, in _Pentaphil_, _Castanea Equina_; Seven, in
_Tormentil_.

7. §. The _Sizes_ of _Leaves_ are innumerable. It is therefore
necessary to reduce them to a Standard. And so, they may be reckoned,
Three; _Small_, _Mean_ and _Great_: with respect to the _Length_ of the
_Leaf_, the _Breadth_, or both. From one Inch and under, all _Leaves_
may be accounted _Small_; from one Inch and over, to five Inches,
_Mean_; from five and over, _Great_.

8. §. The _Shapes_ of _Leaves_ are also numberless. But the most
obvious distinctions which they admit of, are such as these;

9. §. _Leaves_ are _Membraneous_, as the greater part; _Squameous_, as
_Abies_, or _Filamentous_. Which are _solid_, as in _Fenil_, _Meum_,
_Buphthalmum_, _Chamemile_, _Groundpine_; or _hollow_, as in _Onion_.

10. §. _Membraneous_, have all their main _Fibres_ produced either from
the _Stalk_, as in _Holyoak_; or from the middle _Stem_ of the _Leaf_,
as in most. From the midle _Stem_, reciprocally, as in _Scabious_, or
oppositely, that is, one over against another, as in _Rose_: and both
ways, at _Acute Angles_, as in most; or _Right_, as in _Dandelion_.

11. §. Again, they are different with respect to the _Top_, the
_Bottom_, and the _Sides_. The _Top_ is _Thorny_, as in _Furz_; or
_Unarmed_. _Unarmed_, either _Produced_, that is, _Poynted_, or at
least, _Roundish_, as in _Lamium_, _Ironwort_; or else _Reduced_, as
in _Woodsorrel_. And so the _Bottom_, is either _Reduced_ towards
the _Top_, as in _Ground-Ivy_; or _Produced_ upon the _Stalk_, as in
_Poplar_, _Bay_, &c.

12. §. The _Sides_ or _Edges_ of the _Leaf_, are either of one and
the same _Measure_, as commonly; or of divers, as in _Doronicum_.
Both ways they are Even, as in _Syringa_, _Mous-ear_; or Uneven. The
Uneven, are _Prickly_, as _Holly_, _Eryngium_, _Thistle_; or Unarmed.
Unarmed, are Insected, or Resected. Insected deeply, that is, Lobed, as
_Golden Liverwort_, _Clematis Peregrina_; or with shallow _Insections_,
as in most. And so, Indented, or Scallopped: the former, when the
_Angle_ is made with Straight _Lines_, as in _Dandelion_; the latter,
with Crooked, as in _Thalictrum_. Resected, that is, both Lobed, and
Insected, or when upon the greater _Insections_, there are other lesser
ones, as in _Wild-Clary_, _Lovage_, _Masterwort_.


13. §. THE most Conspicuous Varieties of _Flowers_, are in their
_Position_, _Size_, _Shape_, and _Colour_.

14. §. Most are fastned with _Stalks_; but many without. Sometimes,
they are placed round about the _Branch_, that is, Coronated, as in
_Pulegium_; and sometimes, all on one side; either in _Ranks_ only, as
in _Bawm_; or in _Rank_ and _File_, as in _Foxglove_. In _Saxifraga
Aurea_, they grow on the _Leaf_.

15. §. Again, they either stand Singly, as in _Corn Marigold_; or
Clustur’d. And so, either all upon one _Branch_, or on several little
_Ramificated Sprigs_. On one _Branch_, prolonged like a Tail, as in
_Blattaria_; or Contracted. And so, either without _Stalks_, that is,
_Capitated_, as in _Scabious_; or with _Stalks_, that is, _Umbellated_,
as _Fenil_, &c. On several _Sprigs_, as in _Tanacetum_, _Yarrow_.

16. §. The _Sizes_ of _Flowers_, as of the _Leaves_, may be reduced
to Three. From ½ an Inch and under, in _Diameter_ or _Length_, may be
accounted _Small_. From ½ an Inch and over to an Inch and ½, may go for
_Mean_. And from an Inch and v and over, _Great_.

17. In respect of the _Shape_, _Flowers_ are _Open_ or _Belly’d_.
_Open_ have both _Leaves_ and _Attire_, as most; or else are all
_Attire_, as of _Burdock_, _Beta Cretica_.

18. §. The _Open_, consist of a Certain Number of _Leaves_, _One_,
_Two_, _Three_, _Four_, _Five_, _Six_, _Seven_, _Eight_, _Nine_,
_Ten_, _Thirteen_, or _One_ and _Twenty_. Uncertain, commonly called
_Double_. Those of a Certain _Number_, either _Uniform_, that is, all
of a certain _Size_ and _Shape_, as usually; or _Biform_, or _Triform_,
as in _Iris_, _Blattaria_. And these again, Even _Edged_ or _Notched_;
with _Three Poynts_, as in _Marigold_; or _Five_, in _Cichory_.

19. §. The _Belly’d_, are either so in whole; or in Part, that is,
with the _Top_ divided into _Leaves_, and the _Bottom_, _Hollow_: The
former, are also Even _Edged_, as in _Convolvulus_; or _Notched_, as in
_Trachelium_. The latter have their _Leaves_ distinguished as before.
Their _Bottom_ or _Base_, either fastned to the _Seed-Case_, as in
_Snap-dragon_; or standing below it. And so, either Straight, as I
think in _Toad-flax_; or Crooked, as in _Violet_, _Lark-heel_.

20. §. In all these, the _Attire_ is either _Seminiform_, or _Florid_.
And both, _Clustur’d_, or _Divided_; as in _Mallow_, _St. Johns wort_;
_Starwort_, _Hawkweed_.

21. §. The _Colours_ of the _Flower_, are _White_, as in
_Water-Crowfoot_; _Red_, as _Lychnis_; _Blew_, as _Borage_; _Purple_,
as _Stock-July Flower_; _Black_, as in some _Anemones_; _Yellow_, in
_Wall-Flower_; _Tawny_, in _Colus Jovis_; _Green_, in _Laureola_. Which
are either _Single_, or _Mixed_: _Two_ together, as in _Butyr-Bur_,
_White_ and _Red_; in _White Hellibore_, _White_ and _Green_; in _Monks
Rubarb_, _Red_ and _Green_; &c. Or _Three_ together, as in _Pancy_,
_Yellow_, _Blew_, and _Black_, i.e. _atro-purpureus_.

22. §. How far these, and some other like _Distinctions_, being reduced
to _Tables_, would serve for the finding out of any Sort of _Plant_,
may be conceived, if we consider, how great a Variety, a few _Bells_,
in the ringing of Changes, will produce. And the search will be easy,
and successfull, if in every foregoing _Table_, reference be made to
those that follow; and in the _Tables_ conteining the last _Divisions_,
the Names of the _Plants_ therein poynted out, be expressed.

THE _Description_ and _Use_ of _Leaves_ and _Flowers_, together with
the _Figures_ thereto belonging, were presented to this _Honourable
Society_, the last year. I shall conclude this Subject with _Fruits_
and _Seeds_; beginning with _Fruits_, which will take up the present
Discourse.

2. §. And First, I shall describe the Compounding _Parts_ of some, more
generally known. Which having done, I shall next observe the _Uses_ of
the same; either for the _Fruit_ it self, or for the _Seed_. Some of
the _Descriptions_, the Reader may be pleased to compare with those in
the _First_ =Book=. ♦ _Ch. 6._ ♦ I begin with the _Apple_; to which I
shall subjoyn the _Limon_, and _Cucumer_, commonly reduced to the _Pome
Kind_.


3. §. AN APPLE, besides the _Skin_, consisteth of a _Parenchyma_,
_Vessels_, and _Coar_. The _Parenchyma_ or _Pulp_, is the same with
that of the _Barque_ of the _Tree_. As is apparent, not only from the
visible continuation thereof from the one, through the _Stalk_, into
the other: but also from the Structure common to them both; being
both composed of _Bladders_. In which, notwithstanding, there is this
difference, That whereas in the _Barque_, they are _spherical_, and
very small, most of them, through a good _Glass_, not exceeding 1/16ᵗʰ
of an Inch in _Diametre_, and some of them, less: here, they are oblong
and very large, most of them about ⅓ᵈ of an Inch in Length, or more,
according to the largeness and tenderness of the _Fruit_; ♦ _Tab. 65._
♦ being all uniformly tenter’d or stretched out, by the _arching_ of
the _Vessels_, from the _Coar_ towards the Circumference of the _Apple_.

4. §. The _Vessels_, as in the other _Parts_ of a _Plant_, are
_Succiferous_, and for _Aer_. Both the _Branches_ of the former,
and the single _Vessels_ of the latter, are extream small. They run
every where together, not collateral, as _Veins_ and _Arteries_ do in
_Animals_; ♦ _Tab. 65._ ♦ but the latter, sheathed in the former.

5. §. They are distributed into Twenty principal _Branches_. The Ten
outmost, a little within the _Apple_, are diverted from a straight
_Line_, into so many great _Arches_; from which a few small _Fibres_
are without any order dispearsed through the _Apple_. The Five
middlemost, and the Five inmost, run in a straight _Line_ as far as the
_Coar_, and are there diverted into as many lesser _Arches_; ♦ _Tab.
65._ ♦ the former, at the outer, and the latter at the iner _Angles_ of
the _Coar_. Upon these Five inmost hang all the _Seeds_.

6. §. These Ten, and the other Ten abovesaid, do all meet together
at the top of the _Apple_, where originally, they all ran into the
_Flower_. ♦ _Tab. 65._ ♦ But betwixt them, there are scarce any
intercurrent _Fibres_; so that they appear every where disjunct from
the bottom to the top of the _Apple_.


7. §. A LIMON hath a Threefold _Parenchyma_; which seem to be derived
one from another: the _Texture_, upon every derivation, being somewhat
altered, and so made more close and elaborate. ♦ _Tab. 66._ ♦ The
utmost, called the _Rind_, hath the most open, and the coursest
_Texture_; being composed of the largest _Threds_, and those _Threds_
woven up into larger _Bladders_. Those little _Cells_, which contein
the _Essential Oyl_ of the _Fruit_, and stand near the Surface of the
_Rind_, are some of the said _Bladders_ much more dilated.

8. §. From this utmost _Parenchyma_, Nine or Ten _Insertions_ or
_Lamels_ are produced, betwixt as many _Portions_ of the _Pulpy Part_,
towards the Centre, where they all unite into one _Body_, answerable to
the _Pith_ in the _Trunk_ or _Root_ of a _Tree_; and is a conspicuous
demonstration, of the communion betwixt the _Barque_ and the _Pith_;
which there, is much more obscure and difficult to observe. ♦ _Tab.
66._ ♦ At the bottom, but especially the top of the _Fruit_, the _Pith_
is so far expanded, as without the mediation of any _Lamels_, to be
joyned to the _Rind_.

9. §. Throughout this _Parenchyma_, the _Vessels_ are dispearsed. But
the chief _Branches_ stand on the iner Edge of the _Rind_, and the
outer Edge of the _Pith_, ♦ _Tab. 66._ ♦ just at the two extremities of
every _Lamel_. From those _Branches_ on the Edge of the _Pith_, other
little and very short ones shoot into the _Pulp_ of the _Fruit_, upon
which the _Seeds_ are appendant. In the Centre of the _Pith_, are Eight
or Nine, in a _Ring_, which run through the _Fruit_ up to the _Flower_.

10. §. Between the _Rind_ and the _Pith_ and those several _Lamels_,
which joyn them together, stands the second Sort of _Parenchyma_,
different from the former, in being somewhat closer, and finer wrought
Divided, by the _Lamels_, into several distinct Bodies; every one of
them a great and entire _Bag_.

11. §. Within every great _Bag_, is conteined a Third _Parenchyma_,
which is also a Cluster of other little _Bags_, about the bigness of
an _Oate_, all disjoyned one from another, and having their distinct
_Stalks_, ♦ _Tab. 66._ ♦ of several _Lengths_, by which they are
all fastned to the utmost Side of the great _Bag_, wherein they are
conteined. Within each of these lesser _Bags_ are conteined many
hundreds of _Bladders_, consisting of most extream fine _Threds_ woven
up together into that _Figure_. Within these _Bladders_ lies the _Acid
Juyce_ of the _Limon_.


12. §. A CUCUMER, hath also a Threefold _Parenchyma_. The Utmost, is
derived, from the =Barque=. In this, being exposed for some time to
dry, and then cut transversly with a _Rasor_; not only the _Bladders_,
but also the _Threds_ whereof the _Bladders_ consist, through a good
_Microscope_, are apparent.

13. §. Throughout this _Parenchyma_ the _Sap-Vessels_ are dispersed;
near the Circumference, in Ten or Twelve very large _Branches_. ♦
_Tab. 66._ ♦ Each of these larger _Branches_, embosoms another of
_Aer-Vessels_ in its Centre. Adjacent to the Midle _Parenchyma_, they
stand in _Clustres_ of much smaller _Branches_, but more numerous.

14. §. Out of all these _Sap-Vessels_, issues a transparent and viscous
_Mucilage_; which being dryed, becomes as hard and tough as _Gum
Tragacanth_. Analogous to which, I suppose, is the truly purgative part
of _Elaterium_.

15. §. The Midle _Parenchyma_ is derived from the _Pith_; and divided
into Three _Colums_, standing triangularly, and having each of them
a _Triangular Figure_. ♦ _Tab. 66._ ♦ Within these _Colums_ stand a
distinct Sort of _Sap-Vessels_: from whence, several small and short
_Fibres_ shoot into the Inmost _Parenchyma_, whereupon the _Seeds_ do
hang. So that these _Columns_ are as it were the _Beds_ on which the
_Seeds_ grow. With each of the _Seed-Branchs_ or _Fibres_, goes some
part of the said _Parenchyma_ or _Colum_, out of which, the _Covers_ of
the _Seed_ are formed.

16. §. The Inmost _Parenchyma_ wherein the _Seeds_ lie, and which
answers to the _Pulp_ of a _Limon_, seems likewise to be derived from
the _Colums_, ♦ _Tab. 66._ ♦ that is, to be originally thence produced
upon the _Seed-Fibres_, and afterwards spread and augmented into a
_Pulp_. By Three _Insertions_ from the _Colums_, and as many from the
Utmost _Parenchyma_, and these re-inserted; it is divided into Six
_Triangular Bodies_; and every _Triangle_, into Three _Ovals_.

17. §. A near resemblance betwixt the _Garden_ and _Wild Cucumer_, with
respect to the Inward _Structure_, as well as the Outward _Figure_, may
be observed: ♦ _Tab. 66._ ♦ Both of them having a Threefold _Parenchyma_.
Yet with this difference, That the Three _White Triangular Bodies_ or
_Colums_ in the one, is answered by a _White Ring_ or _Tube_ in the
other.




                                CHAP. II.

                        _Of the PEAR and QUINCE._


A PEAR, besides the _Skin_, consisteth of a Twofold _Parenchyma_, of
_Vessels_, _Tartareous Knots_ or _Grains_, and a _Coar_. The _Skin_
is lined with a great number of the said _Tartareous Grains_, through
a _Glass_, about the bigness of small _Shot_: whereby it looks
withinside, like the _Skin_ of the _Scate_ and some other _Fishes_. ♦
_Tab. 67._ ♦ Besides those which grow to the _Skin_, there are also
many more standing near adjacent to it all round about the _Fruit_:
altogether about ⅓ᵈ of an Inch in thickness, through a _Microscope_;
as in a Slice of a _Pear_ cut transversly is apparent. Somewhat more
or less, as I take it, according to the Delicacy or Harshness of the
_Fruit_; as more in a _Burgamy_, or other soft and sweet _Pear_, than
in those which are called _Strangulatoria_. As all _Vinous Liquors_,
and those especially which are the most _Tartareous_, become more soft
and sweet, according as they cast off their _Tartar_, in a greater
quantity, upon the Sides of the _Vessel_.

2. §. The Outer _Parenchyma_, is of the same Original, and general
Structure, as in an _Apple_. But the _Bladders_, answerable to the
Shape of this _Fruit_, not altogether so long, with respect to their
Bredth. ♦ _Tab. 67._ ♦ Throughout this _Parenchyma_, are also dispersed
many small _Tartareous Grains_; most of them somewhat round, as those
next the _Skin_, and of a like _Size_; but nothing near so numerous.

3. §. The _Bladders_ here, have also a different _Position_ from that
they have in an _Apple_: there, they are all stretched out, as to have
respect to one common Centre, which is that of the _Apple_ it self. But
here, they every where bear a respect to the said _Tartareous Grains_,
♦ _Tab. 67._ ♦ every _Grain_ being the Centre of a certain Number of
_Bladders_; like a _Star_, in the midle of its _Vortex_. Whereby, so
many of the _Tartareous parts_ of the _Sap_, as cannot well be thrown
off upon the _Skin_, are more commodiously discharged, upon every
little _Knot_ or _Grain_, nearer hand.

4. §. Throughout this _Parenchyma_, the _Vessels_ likewise are
dispersed. Of the Two general Kinds, for _Sap_, and for _Aer_. The
_Aer-Vessels_, are here extream small, as well as in an _Apple_; yet
one degree, larger. They are both together distributed into Fifteen
principal _Branches_. ♦ _Tab. 67._ ♦ The Five Utmost make as many
_Arckes_, but commonly not near so deep as in an _Apple_. From these,
some small _Fibres_, yet a little more numerously than in an _Apple_,
are dispersed throughout the _Parenchyma_. The Ten Inmost run along to
the _Seed_, and from thence, with the other Five, to the _Flower_.

5. §. Next the _Coar_, stands the Inner _Parenchyma_, in divers
respects different from the Outer. The _Bladders_ of the latter,
as hath been said, large and long; of the former, small and round,
answerable to those of the _Pith_, of which it seems to be derived.
Throughout that, the _Vessels_ and _Tartareous Grains_ are dispersed;
in this, there are neither. The _Effect_ whereof is, that is sweet,
this sower; ♦ _Tab. 67._ ♦ for which reason, I have taken leave to name
it, the _Acetary_.

6. §. Betwixt this and the outer _Parenchyma_, the said _Tartareous
Grains_ begin, first to stand nearer together, to grow biger, and
of a more unequal Surface; and by degrees, to unite into a _Body_,
in some _Pears_, ♦ _Tab. 67._ ♦ and especially towards the _Cork_,
almost as hard as a _Plum-Stone_; which I have thereupon, named the
_Calculary_. ♦ _B. 1. Ch. 6._ ♦ So that a _Pear_, is Natures _Preface_
or _Introduction_ to a _Plum_.

7. §. This _Tartareous Body_, and those small _Grains_ above said, I
have formerly supposed, ♦ _B. 1. Ch. 6._ ♦ to be precipitated out of
the _Sap_, by virtue of the _Vessels_. Which is not only argued from
their growing, where the _Vessels_, only in the outer _Parenchyma_: but
in that the very _Bounds_ or _Figure_ of the _Calculary_, is determined
by the _Situation_ of the chief of those _Vessels_; ♦ _Tab. 67._ ♦ as
in cuting a _Pear_ smoothly through the Centre and by the Length, is
apparent.

8. §. The _Coar_ as well as the _Acetary_, seems to be derived from the
_Pith_. And is therefore lesser here, than in an _Apple_, where the
whole _Pith_ of the _Stalk_, goes to the making of the _Coar_ only.

9. §. In most _Pears_, at the bottom of the _Coar_, and a little below
the Centre of the _Fruit_, there is a kind of small _Umbelical Knot_; ♦
_Tab. 67._ ♦ from whence is extended a straight _Chanel_ or _Ductus_,
which opens at the midle of the _Cork_ or _Stool_ of the _Flower_,
scarce wide enough to admit the smallest _Pin_. Made for the _Use_
hereafter mentioned.


10. §. A QUINCE, is nearly allyed to a _Pear_. The differences betwixt
them are these; In the _Quince_, the outer _Parenchyma_ is more close,
that is, the _Bladders_ are smaller. ♦ _Tab. 67._ ♦ The _Vessels_ more
numerous, and more deeply enarched; the _Calculary_ greater, and more
spread; according to the _Shape_ of the _Fruit_: but the _Acetary_,
less: The _Coar_ stands higher or nearer to the _Cork_; divided, not
into Five, but Four _Cells_. And the _Ductus_ from the bottom of the
_Coar_ to the top of the _Fruit_, much more open and observable.




                               CHAP. III.

       _Of the PLUM, and some other_ Fruits _of the same Kindred._


A PLUM consisteth of a _Parenchyma_, the Two general Kinds of
_Vessels_, and a _Stone_. All which I have already described in the
_First_ =Book=. ♦ _Ch. 6._ ♦ I shall here add, and further clear some
things. And First, it is to be noted, That, in Proportion to the
_Bulk_ of the _Fruit_, there are more _Vessels_ in a _Plum_, than in
an _Apple_, _Pear_, or _Quince_. As also, That in _Plums_, all the
_Vessels_ are braced together into one Uniform Piece of _Net-Work_,
every where terminating at an equal distance from the _Circumference_,
_sc._ ⅛ᵗʰ of an Inch or thereabout. ♦ _Tab. 68._ ♦ And as for the
_Bore_ of the _Aer-Vessels_, although the _Glass_ I used, when I
examined this _Fruit_, would not reach it; yet is it to be presumed,
that they bear a just Proportion to those in the _Trunk_ of the same
_Tree_; and that therefore they are here larger, than in an _Apple_ or
_Pear_. The _Skin_ likewise of a _Plum_, is more _fibrous_, _thick_,
and _tough_, than in those _Fruits_. The Ends of these Diversities, we
shall presently speak of.

2. §. Of the _Stone_, amongst other particulars wherein the contrivance
of Nature is very admirable, I have formerly shewed, ♦ _B. 1. Ch. 6._
♦ That it is composed of Two or rather Three distinct _Bodies_. One
of them, the _Lining_; which answers to the _Coar_ in a _Pear_. And
is originated from the _Parenchyma_, which the _Seed-Branch_ brings
along with it, through the _Chanel_ in the _Side_, and at last into the
_Hollow_, of the _Stone_; and is there spread all over it: as when a
small _Glass-Pipe_, is blown and expanded into a _Bubble_. ♦ _Tab. 68._
♦if a _Bladder_, being stretch-out, and put through the _Neck_ of a
_Bottle_; were then blown up, so as to be every where contiguous to the
_Sides_, and become, as it were, the _Lining_ of the _Bottle_.

3. §. The _Foundation_ or _Ground_ of the Outer and more Bulky _Part_
of the _Stone_, is the Iner _Part_ of the _Parenchyma_; and answers
to the _Acetary_ in a _Pear_. ♦ _Tab. 68._ ♦ As the _Fruit_ grows,
the _Tartareous Parts_ of the _Sap_, being continually precipitated
upon this _Parenchyma_, it is hereby petrify’d. As will best be seen,
by comparing the several _Ages_ of the same _Fruit_ together. And in
some _Stones_; on the Surface whereof, some of the said _Tartareous
Parts_ appear in distinct _Grains_. ♦ _Tab. 68._ ♦ So that whereas
in a _Pear_, the _Calculary_ and the _Acetary_ are distinct, here in
a _Plum_, they are thrown one into the other. Or, as some _Mineral
Waters_ only make a Crust about a Stick or other Bodies immersed in
them; but others, by sinking into these Bodies, do hereby petrify
them: So in a _Pear_, the _Tartareous Parts_ of the _Sap_, only make
a _Crust_ about the _Acetary_; but in a _Plum_, they sink into the
Body thereof, or that _Part_ of the _Parenchyma_, which stands in the
place of it, whereby it is converted into a _Stone_. The _Figures_ of
_Stones_ shall hereafter be spoken of, when I come in the next =Part=,
to the _Covers_ of the _Seed_.


4. §. AN APRECOCK is of the _Plum-Kind_. But some things are herein
better observed. As first, the _Position_ of the _Bladders_ of the
_Parenchyma_. For the _Tartareous Parts_ of the _Sap_ not being here
dispersed, in little _Grains_, throughout the _Fruit_, as in a _Pear_;
but all thrown off into the _Stone_: the _Bladders_ therefore are so
disposed, as not to have respect to several _Centres_, as in a _Pear_;
♦ _Tab. 68._ ♦ but only the _Stone_, to which they all do most exactly
radiate; thereto conveying the _feculent Sap_, in so many little
_Streams_. This is best seen, when the _Fruit_ is full ripe.

5. §. In this _Fruit_, while it is young, the gradual transmutation
of the Inner _Part_ of the _Parenchyma_ into a _Stone_, is also
more apparent. And so are the Three _Coats_, which serve for the
_Generation_ of the _Seed_; being now all very distinct; and
remarkable, not only for their _Bulk_; but also, the _Analogy_ which
they bear to the Three _Membranes_ in many _Viviparous Animals_.
Whereof I shall give a more particular _Description_, when I come, in
the following =Part=, to the _Covers_ of the _Seed_.


6. §. A PEACH hath a much bigger Stone, than either a _Plum_, or an
_Aprecock_: and hath therefore, when full ripe, and especially in
hot Countries, a more desecated or better fined _Juyce_. For the
reason why the _Stone_ is so great, is because the _Vessels_ run so
very numerously through the Body of it; and so cause a more copious
precipitation of the _Lees_ of the _Sap_ thereinto.


7. §. A CHERRY is likewise near related to a _Plum_. But the
_Bracement_ or _Reticulation_ of the _Vessels_, is here carried out
further, ♦ _Tab. 69._ ♦ so as to be all round about contiguous to the
_Skin_. And as the _Aer-Vessels_ in the _Branch_ of a _Cherry-Tree_,
are larger than those of an _Apple-Branch_, but less than those of a
_Plum-Branch_; so may they be presumed, to bear the same Proportion
here in the _Fruit_.


8. §. A WALNUT, is a _Nuciprune_; or betwixt a _Plum_ and a _Nut_, as
a _Bat_ is betwixt a _Beast_ and a _Bird_. For the _Rind_, answers
to the _Pulp_; and the _Shell_, as the _Stone_, is also lined. But
the _Seed-Vessels_, which in a _Plum_ run through a _Chanel_ made on
purpose in the _Stone_; do here enter, as in a _Nut_, at the _Centre_
of the _Shell_. By which means, they are invested with a more fair
_Parenchyma_; which Nature hath provided, as her _Cloth_, for the
making of the _Coats_ wide enough for so vast a _Kernel_.




                                CHAP. IV.

                 _Of the GRAPE, and HAZEL-NUT; with some
               other_ Fruits, _analogous to each of them._


A GRAPE, is a _Plum_ with two _Stones_; for their thickness, as hard
as any other. ♦ _Tab. 69._ ♦ The _Distribution_ of the _Vessels_ is
also somewhat different. For the principal _Fibres_ running up directly
betwixt the _Stones_; and the smaller, making only one single _Net_,
near the Circumference; they all meet together at the _Top_ of the
_Grape_. It is also to be noted, That many _Lignous Fibres_ are visibly
mixed with the _Skin_ it self: whereby it becomes very thick and tough.
And as the _Aer-Vessels_ in the _Trunk_ of a _Vine_, are greater than
in that of an _Apple_, _Pear_, or _Plum_: So is it to be presumed, that
in a _Grape_, they are greater than in the _Fruits_ of those _Trees_.

2. §. The _Parenchyma_ or _Pulp_ of a _Grape_, seems to be derived,
not from the _Barque_, as in an _Apple_; nor partly from the _Barque_,
and partly from the _Pith_, as in a _Goosberry_; but wholly from the
_Pith_; at least, as far as the _Reticulation_ of the _Fibres_; and the
_Skin_ only from the _Barque_; whereby the _Pulp_ becomes so tender and
delicate a _Meat_.


3. §. A GOOSBERRY, hath a Threefold _Parenchyma_. The Utmost is derived
from the _Barque_; of a _Greener Colour_, and very _Sappy_. The
midlemost, from the _Pith_; somewhat _white_, and more _dry_, as the
_Diametral Insertions_ in some _Roots_. In both of them, the _Bladders_
are very conspicuous, above what they are in any _Fruit_, I at present
think of; so as to be visible to a good Eye without a _Glass_. ♦ _Tab.
69._ ♦

4. §. Betwixt these Two _Parenchymas_, do run most of the principal
_Fibres_, or _Vascular Threds_. ♦ _Tab. 69._ ♦ From which several
smaller ones are branched into the Inmost _Parenchyma_; upon which, the
_Seeds_ do hang.

5. §. Each of these smaller _Branches_ is invested with some part of
the midle or white _Parenchyma_. Serving partly to make the _Covers_
of the _Seed_; and partly, the _Pulp_, that is, the Inmost and finest
_Parenchyma_ of the _Berry_, in which the _Seed_ lies.


6. §. A _White_ CORIN, without taking off the _Skin_, sheweth not
unpleasantly how the _Seeds_ are fastned. For as the _Trunk_ of the
_Tree_ continues not to any considerable Length, entire, as in a
_Plum_, but is presently divided into several _Boughs_; nor are the
Edges of the _Leaf_ entire, as also in a _Plum_, but slit into several
_Lobes_; and the _Fruit_, into a great many _Corins_ in a _Bunch_: So
again, the _Seeds_ do hang upon the _Fibres_, like Two other _Bunches_,
in every _Corin_. As by _Refraction_, Objects of all _Sizes_ are
represented on the _Walls_ of the _Eye_. The _Operations_ of _Nature_
being every where Uniform: and sometimes the same in small, transcribed
from a greater _Copy_.


7. §. A NUT, is a _Plum_ inverted, or turned inside outward. For
the _Shell_, standing naked, includes the _Parenchyma_: the bearded
_Cap_, not precisely answering to _that_, but to the _Empalement_ of
the _Flower_; ♦ _Tab. 69._ ♦ which likewise in many other _Plants_,
out-lives the _Foliature_ and Embosomes the _Uterus_ of the _Seed_.
And whereas the _Stone_ of a _Plum_ is not Faced, but Lined with a
_Parenchyma_ derived at second hand from the _Pith_: The _Shell_ of a
_Nut_ is not Lined, but Faced with the iner _Skin_ of the _Cap_.


8. §. AN AKERN, is the _Nut_ of an _Oak_. Yet with this difference;
That besides the _Cup_, it stands in, it hath only a _Leathern_ or
_Parchment Cover_ instead of a _Shell_. From whence it come to pass,
that whereas the _Kernel_ of a _Nut_ is sweet; that of an _Akern_, is
of a very rough _Tast_: the _Austere Parts_ of the _Sap_, which in
a _Nut_ are drained off into the _Shell_, being here imbibed by the
_Kernel_ it self.




                                CHAP. V.

                    _Of the SEED-CASE or MEMBRANEOUS
                                UTERUS._

TO the forementioned _Fruits_, I shall subjoyne, in some Examples, the
_Description_ of the _Seed-Case_, which is analogous to the _Fruit_.
For the _Fruit_, strictly so called, is, _A Fleshy Uterus, which grows
more moist and Pulpy, as the Seed ripens_. But the _Seed-Case_, whether
it be called a _Cod_, _Pod_, or by any other name, is, _A Membraneous
Uterus, which as the Seed ripens, still grows the more dry and hard_:
as in most _Plants_.


2. §. THE SEED-CASE, is either originally open; Or only when the _Seed_
is ripe; Or never opens at all, till the _Seed_ be sown. Of the first
Sort, is that of _Luteola_; as also of _Clary_, _Sage_, _Hysop_, and
the like: wherein one and the same _Part_, is both the _Empalement_
of the _Flower_, and when that is gone, survives as the _Case_ of the
_Seed_.

3. §. Of the Last, is that of _Myagrum Monspermon_, _Lithosperme_, all
the _Stones_ of _Fruits_, with divers others. And some _Cases_, which
are soft, as, I think, that of _Garden Radish_. The former, by cleaving
in some _part_ or other; these only by roting under Ground.


4. §. THAT of _Garden Radish_, is a Light and Spongy or Pithy _Body_;
originally, every where entire. But, as it ripens, breaks within, into
several White and Dry _Membranes_ round about the _Seed_. ♦ _Tab. 70._
♦ By the Length and about ⅛ᵗʰ of an Inch distant from the _Sides_ of
the _Case_, do run a pair of little _Vascular Ropes_. Some smaller
_Fibres_ are from these transmitted to the _Sides_ of the _Case_;
by which they are kept tite and steady. Upon divers others produced
towards the _Centre_, hang the _Seeds_, like Two _Ropes_ of _Onions_.

5. §. Of those which open so soon as the _Seed_ is ripe; some are made
to open at the _Top_, as _Popy Heads_; Some on the _Side_, as most
_Cods_; and some at the _Bottom_, as that of _Coded Arsmart_.


6. §. THE _Popy-Head_, is a little _Dove Coat_; divided by Eight or Ten
_Partitions_, into so many _Stalls_. On both _Sides_ the _Partitions_,
hangs a most numerous _Brood_ of _Seeds_. ♦ _Tab. 70._ ♦ The
_Partitions_ and _Sides_ of the _Head_, are made of the _Barque_, and
Lined with the _Pith_. While young, they are very _thick_ and _spongy_;
and together with the _Seeds_, do then fill all up. The _Head_ is then
also every where entire; but as it dries, it gradually opens at the
_Top_, into several _Windows_, one for every _Stall_: which are all
covered with a very fair _Canopy_. A _Fabrick_ designed for several
purposes, as shall hereafter be said.

7. §. Of those which open on the _Side_; some are made to open, only on
One _Side_; some, on both _Sides_; some, with Three _Sides_; some, with
more; and some horizontally or round about.


8. §. THE COD of _Garden Bean_ (and so the rest of the _Leguminous_
kind) opens on one _Side_. It hath a Twofold _Parenchyma_. The Utmost
derived from the _Barque_: in which stand all the _Vessels_, in several
_Parcels_; ♦ _Tab. 70._ ♦ one whereof, at the _Back_ of the _Cod_, is
much larger than the rest, shaped like a _Copula_ used in _Schemes_;
from whence shoot those lesser _Fibres_ upon which the _Beans_ do grow.

9. §. The Inner _Parenchyma_ is derived from the _Pith_. Upon its
Nativity, and for some time afterwards, entire and wholly composed
of _Bladders_, as the Outer. From the _Base_ of the _Cod_ they are
gradually enlarged, so as to compose this _Parenchyma_ into a very soft
and delicate _Sponge_. ♦ _Tab. 70._ ♦ In which (the _Cod_ being well
grown) the very _Threds_ whereof the _Bladders_ were woven, are many of
them so loose and ample, as easily to be drawn out (as in the unroaving
of _Knit-work_) to a considerable Length, fairly visible through an
ordinary _Glass_.

♦ _B. 2. P. 1. Ch. 5._ & _B. 3. P. 1. Ch. 4._ ♦ 10. §. This may further
confirm all that I have formerly said of the _Fibrous Texture_ of the
_Pith_, and of all the other _Parenchymous Parts_ of _Plants_.


11. §. THE _Seed-Case_ of _Medica_, is a _Cod_ wound up: in the
_Echinata_, _Spirally_; in the _Tornata_, by an _Helix_. Not finished
all together; but, upon the fall of the _Flower_, beginning to wind,
continues its _Circles_, till it be come to its full _Growth_.


12. §. THE _Seed-Case_ of _Yellow Henbean_ opens on both _Sides_. ♦
_Tab. 70._ ♦ On the _Top_, is erected a _Colum_, about ½ an Inch long;
which, as the _Case_ swells, grows less, and at last falls off. On the
_Sides_ of the _Uterus_ or _Case_, Two _Vascular Fibres_ run oppositely
from the bottom to the top, and so into the _Colum_. Along the _Tract_
of these _Fibres_, the _Case_, as it ages, gradually cleaves on both
_Sides_ asunder.

13. §. The _Case_ is lined with a dry and thin _Parchment_, as
smooth as _Glass_. ♦ _Tab. 70._ ♦ In the _Centre_ of the _Case_,
stands a great _Parenchymous Boss_, which is, as it were, the _Bed_
or _Placentula_ of the _Seeds_; which lie all over it, as in a
_Strawberry_. And so in many other _Plants_. Throughout this _Bed_, the
_Vessels_ for the _Generation_ and _Nourishment_ of the _Seeds_, are
distributed; one very small _Fibre_, shooting, from the direct ones,
obliquely into each _Seed_.


14. §. THE _Seed-Case_ of _Tulip_, opens with Three _Sides_; being,
when young, a _Prism_ or long _Triangle_. From the midle of each
_Side_, a _Partition_ or _Boord_ is produced; all three meeting in
the _Centre_ of the _Case_; ♦ _Tab. 71._ ♦ and so parting it into Six
_Stalls_ for the _Seed_. The insides hereof, are, lined with a thin
smooth and glossy _Parchment_, like that in _Hen-bean_; derived from
the _Pith_; as the outside, from the _Barque_: and so in many other
_Seed-Cases_.

15. §. The _Vessels_, after they rise above the _Stalk_, are disposed
with great _artifice_. For first, they are divided into Three principal
_Branches_, which run a long the Three _Angles_ of the _Case_; ♦ _Tab.
71._ ♦ where the Three _Sides_, as it ages, gradually cleave asunder.
From these chief _Branches_, at the Three _Angles_, divers lesser ones
run horizontally, and meet at the midle of each _Side_. From whence
again, many yet smaller ones are produced through the bredth of each
_Partition_ to their Edges in the _Centre_ of the _Case_. Where, once
more, they are distributed into very fine and short _Threds_, whereupon
hang the _Seeds_.


16. §. THE _Seed-Case_ of _Stramonium_ or _Thorn Apple_, is divided
into Four _Closets_: Not open one into another, as in _Poppy_, _Tulip_,
&c. but so many distinct _Inclosures_. ♦ _Tab. 71._ ♦ In the midst of
each _Closet_ stands a _Colum_, joyned to the _Side_ of the _Closet_ by
a _Wall_ or _Lamine_. Through the Length of the _Colums_ run several
greater and lesser _Branches_ of _Vessels_, from whence others are
obliquely produced, upon which the _Seeds_ grow.


17. §. THE _Seed-Case_ of _Anagallis_ or _Pimpernel_, is a little
_Globe_; which opens not by its _Meridian_ or _Vertically_, as do
the former; but by its _Horizon_. ♦ _Tab. 71._ ♦ For divers very
small _Fibres_, being produced from the _Stalk_ to the midle of the
_Case_; do there fetch a _Circle_, and so divide it exactly into Two
_Hemispheres_: the Uppermost of which, when the _Seeds_ are ripe,
falleth off; and so the wind sowes them.


18. §. THE _Seed-Case_ of _Coded Arsmart_, neither opens at the _Top_,
nor on the _Sides_, as do all the former; but at the _Bottom_. It is
composed of Four _Sides_: the Outer Part of which, is softer and more
_succulent_; ♦ _Tab. 71._ ♦ the Inner a tite and strong _Membrane_. In
the _Centre_ of the _Case_, is erected a _Pole_ or _Colum_ upon which
the _Seeds_ do all hang very loosely.

19. §. From this _Mechanism_, the manner of that violent and surprising
_Ejaculation_ of the _Seeds_, is intelligible. Which is not a motion
originally in the _Seeds_ themselves; but contrived by the _Structure_
of the _Case_. For the _Seeds_ hanging very loose, and not on the
_Sides_ of the _Case_, as sometimes, but on the _Pole_, in the
_Centre_, with their thicker end downward, they stand ready for a
discharge: and the _Sides_ of the _Case_ being lined with a strong and
Tensed _Membrane_, they hereby perform the office of so many little
_Bows_: which, remaining fast at the _Top_, and (contrary to what we
see in other _Plants_) opening or being _lett off_ at the _Bottom_,
forceably curle upward, and so drive all the _Seeds_ before them.




                                CHAP. VI.

                _Of the USE of the_ Parts _to the_ Fruit.


IN the forgoing _Descriptions_, I have already mention’d the _Use_ of
the _Parts_ in some particulars. I shall now a little further explain
the manner of their service, both to the _Fruit_, and to the _Seed_.

2. §. And first, the _Vessels_ serve for the _Figuration_ of the
_Fruit_. So in an _Apple_, the Ten great and utmost _Branches_ serve
not only to nourish and feed it; but also, by the _Arched Lines_ they
draw, to direct and govern the _Growth_ thereof into an orbicular
_Figure_. The _Dilatation_ of these _Vessels_, not being hindred
by any _Braces_ or _Conjunction_ with the _Interior_ ones. By the
_Slenderness_ of the _Aer-Vessels_, as in the _Root_, so here in the
_Fruit_, much promoted. And by their _Saline Principle_, first begun.

3. §. The Five midlemost and the Five Inmost serve together, to
figure the _Coar_; the former bounding the Outer, the Latter, the
Iner _Angles_. For were they only Five, or were all Ten in the same
_Circle_, they would only make a round _Cavity_ like that of a hollow
_Pith_. Hence it is that _Apples_, in which some small _Threds_ of the
_Vessels_ strike out into the _Circumference_, are very Uneven with
divers _Knobs_ and _Ridges_. But _Plums_, _Cherries_, &c. where the
_Vessels_ all terminate at an Equal distance from the _Skin_, are Even
all round about.

4. §. The _Bulk_ of the _Fruit_ dependeth also on the _Braces_ of the
_Vessels_. For in _Plums_ and _Cherries_, they are more numerous; but
in _Apples_ and _Pears_ they are very loose one from another, and so
have liberty left them to spread abroad.

5. §. As also on their _Size_; that is, on the _Size_ of the
_Aer-Vessels_. Which, the less they are themselves, they serve to make
a bigger _Fruit_. As the less they are in any _Root_, they serve to
make it the more ample. For the less they are, the more pliable to the
_Attraction_ of the _Aer_: and in their _Growth_ must make so many more
spiral _Rings_: by both which means, they make the greater _Arches_.
And therefore a _Pear_ is commonly a smaller _Fruit_ than an _Apple_;
a _Plum_ than a _Pear_; and a _Grape_, than a _Plum_; in all which the
_Aer-Vessels_ are still greater and greater.

6. §. From the same Cause, it is also most agreeable, That the _Fruit_
should not come before the _Leaves_ or _Flower_, but last of all.
For the _Aer-Vessels_, as hath been often noted, are not exactly
_Cylindrick_, but tapered; that is, not only the _Fibres_ consisting
of divers of these _Vessels_, but the _Vessels_ themselves, as they
ascend into the _Trunck_, _Branches_, _Leaves_, _Flower_, and _Fruit_,
grow still more and more slender. So that the smallest coming last,
and being the most pliable; they are also best accommodated for the
_Expansion_ of the _Parenchyma_ into that we call the _Fruit_.

7. §. It is likewise a proper Question to be asked, How it comes to
pass, That some _Plants_ bear a _Fruit_, and not all? I answer, That as
the _Size_ of the _Aer-Vessels_ conduceth to the _Bulk_ of the _Fruit_,
and the Order of its Growth: So the _Number_ of them, to there being,
or not being, any _Fruit_ at all. For the _Fruit_, as we have already
defined it, is an _Uterus_, which grows moyster and softer, as the
_Seed_ ripens. The reason therefore, why the _Uterus_ in some _Plants_,
continues moist and soft after the _Seed_ is ripe; and in some, dries
up; is, Because in the former, there is a smaller, in the latter, a
greater _Quantity_ of the _Aer-Vessels_ in proportion to the other
_Parts_ of the _Uterus_, and so a greater quantity of _Aer_. Which as
in the _Pith_ of most _Plants_, so here, by degrees excludes the _Sap_,
or rendering it more evaporable, comes in the room of it; and so the
_Uterus_ is dryed up: that is, there is no _Fruit_ produced, but only a
_Seed-Case_.

8. §. From the _Size_, _Number_, and _Position_ of all the _Vessels_
in _Fruits_ a reason also may be given, for the diversity of their
_Tasts_. Some Instances have before been given; to which I shall add
one or two more. So the _Rind_ of an _Orange_, is bitter; the _Pulp_,
sower. Because the former is furnished with many _Lignous Vessels_,
the _Sulphureous_ or _Oyly Tincture_ whereof, being copiously mixed
with the _Acid_ of the _Parenchyma_, produce that _Tast_. Whereas the
_Pulp_, which is very sower, is void of all manner of _Vessels_. But
if the _Sap-Vessels_ are either less numerous or less _Sulphureous_;
they give so mild a _Tincture_ to the _Parenchyma_, as not to produce
a bitter, but a sweet or soft _Tast_; as in _Apples_, _Grapes_,
_Goosberries_, &c. And of a _Goosberry_, it is particularly to be
noted, that whereas, in a _Limon_, the _Pulp_ only is sower, as being
void of _Vessels_: here, on the contrary, the _Pulp_ only is sweet,
whereinto all the _Vessels_ strike, and the _Rind_ sower.

9. §. The diversities of the _Skin_ it self, have their _Use_. And
therefore, the more tender and delicate the _Fruit_ is; the _Skin_, on
the contrary, is thicker and more tough. So _Apples_ have a thicker
_Skin_, than _Pears_; _Plums_, than _Apples_; and _Grapes_ than
_Plums_; those having as it were, only a _Coat_ of _Kid_, but this of
good thick _Buff_. And therefore some _Fruits_, although tender, yet
either not having so rich a _Juyce_, or coming early, and so not being
exposed to excessive heats, have a very thin _Skin_, as _Mulberries_,
_Strawberries_, &c.




                               CHAP. VII.

       _Of the USE of the_ Parts _to the_ Seed. _And the TIME, in
       which the_ Uterus _or_ Fruit _and_ Seed-Case _are formed._


AND first, for example, in an _Apple_, the Five Inmost _Branches_, do
best serve for the _Generation_ of the _Seed_; these running into the
_Attire_ of the _Flower_, and so carrying off the most _Aerial Spirit_
from the _Seed_; ♦ _P. 2. Ch. 5. §. 5._ ♦ by which means, it becomes
a more compact and denser _Body_, than the _Fruit_, and so more
accommodate to the process of _Vegetation_; as hath formerly been
shewed.

2. §. The _Elongation_ likewise of the _Seed-Vessels_, in the _Fruit_
and _Case_, sometimes directly, as in _Plums_ and _Nuts_, and sometimes
by several _Ambages_ before they shoot into the _Seeds_, as in _Tulip_;
shewes a design for the highest refining and maturation of the _Seminal
Sap_.

3. §. Chiefly by means of the Inmost _Vessels_, is made that _Chanel_
in some _Pears_, and especially in _Quinces_. For these perishing with
the _Flower_, the circumjacent _Parenchyma_ shrinks up, leaving the
said _Chanel_ in the midst. Designed for an inlet to the _Aer_, for the
better drying of the _Seeds_; which here stand the more in need of it,
because encompassed with a _Mucilage_.

4. §. For the better drying of the _Seed_, and the disbursing or sowing
of it in due time, the opening of the _Case_ is, in the same manner,
also contrived: either at the _Top_, as in _Popy_; or on the _Sides_,
as in _Tulip_, _Pimpernel_; or at the _Bottom_, as in _Coded Arsmart_.
All which openings are effected by the running of the _Aer-Vessels_
along those places: for by drying the _Parenchyma_ next adjacent, they
cause it to chop and cleave asunder.

5. §. Of the _Seed-Case_ of _Poppy_, it is particularly to be noted,
That as the several _Windows_, serve to let in _Aer_, for the drying
of the _Seeds_, after their full Growth: So the _Canopy_ over them,
serves to keep out _Rain_. For here, the _Case_ not cleaving down the
_Side_, as it usually doth; should the _Rain_ get in, it would stand in
it, as in a _Pot_, and so rot the _Seeds_. And as the _Canopy_ serves
to preserve the _Seeds_; so the several _Partitions_ or _Walls_, for
their better _Stowage_. For by an easie survey of this little piece of
Ground, it is plain, that as they stand on both _Sides_ every _Wall_,
there is as much more Ground for them to stand upon, as if there were
no parting _Walls_, but the _Seeds_ stuck all round about upon the
_Ambit_ or _Sides_ of the _Case_; or upon a great _Bed_ or _Placenta_
within it, as in _Hyoscyamus_, _Anagallis_, &c. where there is a less
numerous _Brood_.

6. §. The _Coar_ likewise, by standing betwixt the moyst _Parenchyma_
and the _Seed_, and being hollow and so filled with _Aer_; doth much
conduce to the ripening and drying of the _Seed_, and its greater
fitness both for keeping, and sowing. So the _Parchment Lining_ of the
_Seed-Case_, as in _Hyoscyamus_, &c. is answerable to a _Coar_.

7. §. The _Parenchyma_ serveth, amongst other purposes, for the
_Generation_ of the _Covers_ of the _Seed_; as in some instances hath
been shewed. For which intent, sometimes the _Exterior Parenchyma_,
as in a _Limon_; sometimes the midlemost, as in a _Goosberry_ or
_Cucumer_, is subservient; both of them, in those _Fruits_, being more
white and dry, than the rest, and so fiter to make the _Covers_ of the
_Seed_.

8. §. The _Parenchyma_ is also of use for the warmth of the _Seed_;
as in the _Seed-Case_ of _Garden Radish_. Wherein, as it ripens the
_Parenchyma_ gradually drys, breaks, and shrinks up into several soft
_Membranes_, in which the _Seeds_, in the Centre of the _Case_, lie
swadled, as in so many fine _Calico Cloths_.


9. §. I SHALL conclude with observing the _Time_ of the _Generation_
of the _Fruit_ and _Seed-Case_. This hath hitherto been thought to be
initiated upon the opening, I say not, the forming, but the opening of
the _Flower_, or not long before. Notwithstanding which, what I have
formerly said of the _Flower_; I now do the like, of the _Uterus_ it
self; _sc._ That in very many _Plants_, ’tis formed, with the _Flower_,
the year before it appears and comes to its full _Growth_. ♦ _Tab.
71._ ♦ As for instance, in _Azarum_, not only all the _Parts_ of the
_Flower_, but the _Uterus_ it self, and there in also the outer _Cover_
of the _Seed_ of any one year, are perfectly formed in _August_ or
_September_ of the year foregoing. The like may be seen in _Tulip_,
_Mezereon_, _Corin_, and many other _Perennial Plants_.

                                CHAP. I.

                       _Of the FIGURES of_ Seeds.


THE _Figures_ of _Seeds_, or rather of their outward _Covers_, are made
suitable, Partly to their _Collocation_ in the _Uterus_, as the _End_.
So those of _Mallow_, standing like a Coronet round the _Stalk_, are
of a wedged _Figure_; whereby their sharp Edges do all meet together
in one _Centre_. Partly, to the various distribution of the _Vessels_
or _Fibers_, as one _Cause_: by which the _Measures_ and _Surface_ of
_Seeds_, as well as of the _Leaves_ of _Plants_, are diversified. And
partly, to the Nature of the _Saline_ and other _Principles_ regent
in a _Plant_, as another principal _Cause_. And therefore the more
_stony_, _brittle_, or full of _Salt_ the _Covers_ of any _Seeds_
are, they are generally more _angular_, and their _Figure_, whether
_angular_ or not, more constantly observed. So the _Tartareous Stone_
of a _Plum_, is not only more _angular_, but also more regular than the
Husk of the Kernel of a _Pear_ or _Apple_.

2. §. For all Stones are measured by several _Circles_, whose
_Diametres_ hold a certain proportion to the Length of the _Stone_; in
the same manner as hath been shewed in the description of the _Leaf_. ♦
_P. 1. Ch. 3._ ♦ So the _Stone_ of the _Pease-Cod-Plum_, is measured by
two _Circles_. That of the _Turkey-Plum_ with Four. ♦ _Tab. 72._ ♦ That
of the _Aprecok-Plum_, with Two repeated oppositely; being perfectly
_Rhomboid_. To which, those also of the _Wheat-Plum_, _Damasceen_, and
some others, allude. And some are measured by four _Circles_, and one
repeated.

3. §. The _Figures_, not only of the larger sort of _Seeds_, but even
of the smallest, have much and elegant variety. We will take the
pleasure of comparing these which follow.

4. §. And first of all, some are perfectly _Spherick_, and with an
even _Surface_; ♦ _Tab. 73._ ♦ as that of little _Century_. That of
_Spergula_ is also _Spherick_; but hath a knobed _Surface_, and is
encompassed with a _Membraneous Rimm_, like the _Horizon_ of a Globe.
That of little _Celandine_ is Circular, but compressed like a _Cheese_.

5. §. Others are _Nephroideous_, or as it were _Hemispherick_. Of which
_Figure_, and hereunto approaching, there are a greater number than
of any other; as that which agrees with the more frequent _Shape_ and
_Fold_ of the _Lobes_ and _Radicle_ of the _Seed_, as shall be seen.
Yet with some difference, as to their _Shape_ and _Surface_. So, that
of _Lychnis Sylvestris_ is figur’d just like the kidney of a _Cat_; and
hath a knobed _Surface_. ♦ _Tab. 73._ ♦ That of _Poppey_ comes near it
in _Shape_; but hath a _Surface_ exactly like that part of the _Paunch_
of a _Sheep_, called the _Hony-Coome_. That of great _Celandine_, is a
little more oblong; and so, like the Kidney, not of a _Cat_, but of a
_Sheep_: chequered with parallel _Rings_ and other short _Lines_ placed
alternately betwixt them.

6. §. Where, by the way, we may see, as well by the _Seed_, as by
the other _Parts_, of how different kinds, the Great and Little
_Celandine_, notwithstanding their Names, are to be esteemed.

7. §. The _Seed_ also of _Ben_ or _spatling Poppey_ is somewhat like a
_Kidney_: ♦ _Tab. 73._ ♦ but hath its Circumference raised up into a
double _Ridge_: to which several small _Ridges_ do in some sort also
radiate from one _Centre_ _sc._ the _Base_ of the _Seed_.

♦ _Tab. 73._ ♦ 8. §. The _Seed_ of _Chickweed_, is partly like
a _Kidney_, and partly like a little _Retort_. As also that of
_Pentaphyl. fragiferum_. But the former is rough cast with small
pieces having as it were feet on each side, like little _Insects_.
With which, the _Seed_ of _Leuchanthemum_ (which may be called, the
_Giant-Chickweed_) doth much agree. The latter, hath several _Fibrous
Ridges_, resembling the _Fibres_ in the _Auricles_ of the _Heart_; or
running from the nose to the Circumference, somewhat like the _Azymuth
Lines_ on a _Quadrant_.

♦ _Tab. 73._ ♦ 9. §. Some are _Oval_; as that of the little _Bell_, and
rough cast with _Fibres_ almost parallel and produced by the Length of
the _Seed_. In which latter respect, the _Seeds_ also of _Trachelium_
and some other like _Plants_, are agreeable. That of _Brooklime_, is
also _Oval_, but encompassed with a thick _Rimm_, narrowing all the way
to the _Base_ of the _Seed_.

10. §. The _Seed_ of _Dovesfoot_ hath an _oval Cone_, and a flat
_Base_. Its _Surface_ favous, like that of _Poppy_, _Toad-flax_,
and some other _Seeds_. ♦ _Tab. 73._ ♦ That of _Sedum minus æstivum
luteum_, is in a manner the _Figure_ of the former inverted, being
flat, not at the _Base_, but on the _Top_. And whereas that rises with
a blunt _Angle_, this hath only a _Ridg_, raised above the _Surface_ of
the _Seed_.

11. §. The _Seeds_ of divers sorts of _Grass_, are more _Conick_, as
particularly of that, which for the likeness its _Seed_ hath to a
_Barly Corn_, may be called _Barley-Grass_. And I little doubt, but
that among the several sorts of _Grass_, ♦ _Tab. 73._ ♦ there are some
which answer to all the kinds of _Esculent Grains_, as _Oat-Grass_,
_Rice-Grass_, _Wheat-Grass_, _Rye-Grass_. And accordingly, that they
may be more profitably sown in one Ground, than in another; and used
with distinction, for the higher, or more wholsome feeding of Cattle.
A _Rush_, though it seems an imperfect _Plant_, yet besides its
_Flower_, hath also a plentiful brood of _Seeds_ of a _Conick Figure_.

12. §. Some _Seeds_ are _Cylindrick_, as that of St. _Johns-wort_,
as also of _Tutsan_, and some other like _Plants_, with some little
diversity in the _Shape_ or _Surface_ of the _Seed_. ♦ _Tab. 73._ ♦
That of _Vervain_, is in a manner, half a _Cylinder_: the true _Seed_
lying in the _Covers_, like a Child, in a Cradle without an head.

13. §. Others are rather _Conico-Cylindrick_, as that of _Jacobæa_; ♦
_Tab. 73._ ♦ having a Coronet on the top, and several furrows by the
Length round about. Answerable to which, is that of _Erygerum_; in
_Shape_ not unlike to a _Rowling-pin_.

14. §. Some are _Plani-Conick_, as that of _Nettle_, which is shaped
somewhat like the end of a _Speer_. That of _Eye-bright_ is more
_Eliptick_; with several _Ridges_ running by the Length; and joyned
together with short pieces transversly, as in the looping of _Lace_.
♦ _Tab. 74._ ♦ That of _Wormwood_ not very unlike a little flat
_Essence-Glass_: in which, the _Fibres_ are produced by the Length,
as the _Ridges_ are in _Eye-bright_. And so in _Yarrow_, which is
also encompassed with a _Membraneous Rimm_. That of _Dandelyon_,
is _Plani-Conick_ towards the _Base_. And so those of _Lettice_,
_Sonchus_, and some others. To which, those also of _Hieraceum_,
_Tragopogon_, _Scorzonera_, &c. with respect to their _Surface_, do all
allude.

15. §. And some are _Conico-Triangular_. Of which, that of _Sorrel_ is
_Conick_ at both ends; the sides equal; and upon every _Angle_, hath a
narrow and sharp _Rimm_. As also that of _Anagallis_; but the _Sides_
are _Spheri-conick_, and so the ends are blunt. ♦ _Tab. 74._ ♦ They are
also pounced with many little round _Cavities_. But have no _Rimm_ upon
the _Angles_.

16. §. The _Seed_ of _Nigella_ is _Triangular_, and _Conick_ only at
the _Top_. On every _Angle_, hath a narrow _Rimm_; the three _Sides_
equal, and _Spheri-conick_; surrounded with seven or eight _Ridges_ by
the girth, joyned together in some places with others transversly. ♦
_Tab. 74._ ♦ That of _Arsmart_, is also _Triangular_ and _Conick_ at
the _Top_. But one of the _Sides_ is almost equal to the other two;
which stand low. That of _Knot-Grass_ hath three _Sides_, one less than
another; being as 5, 3, and 2, or thereabout.

17. §. The next (which I take to be the _Seed_ of a sort of _Bugloss_)
is very oddly _figured_. The _Base_, _oval_; the _Top_, _conick_; the
_Back_, swelling and round as an _Egg_; ♦ _Tab. 74._ ♦ the _Belly_ also
swelling, but rising up into an obtuse _Angle_ highest in the midle,
somewhat like a _Breastpiece_ of _Armour_: and is encompassed with a
_Rimm_ sloaped upward.

18. §. That of _Moldavian Bawm_, is _Triangular_, and _Conick_ only at
the _Base_. The place where it is fastned, shaped like the Beard of a
Dart. Two of the _Sides_ are _Plani-conick_, the Third _Spheri-conick_,
♦ _Tab. 74._ ♦ and near as big as both the other two. The _Head_ flat,
with a _Rimm_ erected upon each _Side_, so as to make a _Spherical
Triangle_. Approaching to this, are those of _Sage_, _Horehound_,
_Clary_, &c.

19. §. That also of _Bellis Tanaceti folio_, hath two _Sides
Planiconick_, and a third _Sphericonick_. ♦ _Tab. 74._ ♦ The two first
have several _Ridges_ running to the _Base_. Which is not perfectly
_conick_, but a little dilated into two obtuse _Angles_. The _Head
Triangular_, with one _Side_ convex, the other Two straight, a little
hollowd, and having a small pinacle in the _Center_.

20. §. That of _Stæchas Arabica_, as the former, saving, that the
_Head_ is _oval_, and the _Base_ sloaped into a little _Triangle_.
That of _Wartwort_ or _Sun-Spurge_, hath a very complex _Figure_. The
_Belly_ consisteth of two _Planiconick_ Sides, as the former; the
Back, _Sphericonick_. ♦ _Tab. 74._ ♦ The whole _Seed_, in a manner,
_Conick-oval_. Yet the _Base_ and _Head_ both flat. In the midle of
the former, a Peg by which the _Seed_ is fastned; and of the latter,
a poynted _Knob_. The midle of the _Belly-Sides_, hollowed, so as to
make a flat _Rimm_ of equal _Bredth_; and the hollows filled up with
_Bladders_ like those in all the _Parenchymus Parts_ of a _Plant_.

21. §. Lastly, there are some _Seeds_ which are square. Whereof some
are straight, as that of _Fox-glove_; ♦ _Tab. 74._ ♦ which hath also
an even _Surface_: And that of _Blattaria_, in which there are several
little hollows in even Rows. And so in _Brounwort_.

22. §. And some _Convex_, as that of _Chrysanthemum Americ_. ’Tis
_Quadrati-conick_, or square and sharp at the _Base_, and big at the
_Head_. ♦ _Tab. 74._ ♦ The _Sides_ all plain; and a thin _Rimm_ erected
upon every _Angle_. As also on the four _Sides_ of the _Head_, which is
flat, with a little _Pinacle_ in the midle.

23. §. The _Seed_ also of _Tansey_, is a _Conick_ and bended square not
with the _Angle_ forward, as the former, but the _Side_. ♦ _Tab. 74._ ♦
And in the place of every _Rimm_, hath a round _Ridge_. Somewhat like
to this, are those of _Febrifuga_, _Mayweed_, and some others. Thus far
of the _Figures_ of _Seeds_.




                                CHAP. II.

                  _Of the NUMBER and MOTIONS of_ Seeds.


NATURE hath secured the _Propagation_ of _Plants_ several ways, but
chiefly by the _Seed_: for the _Production_ of which, the _Root_,
_Leaves_, _Flower_, and _Fruit_, do all officiate, as hath been shewed.
And according as the _Plant_, or the _Seed_ it bears, is more liable to
be destroyed, Provision is made for _Propagation_, either by a greater
number of _Seeds_, or other ways. So the _Seeds_ of _Strawberry_,
being gathered, or eaten by _Vermin_, with the _Fruit_; the _Plant_
is therefore easily propagated by _Trunk-Roots_. So _Poppy_, being an
annual _Plant_, is highly prolifick: for instance, the _White Poppy_;
which commonly bears about four mature _Heads_, in each of which, there
are at least ten _Partitions_, on both sides whereof, the _Seeds_ grow;
and upon ¼ᵗʰ part of one side, about 100 _Seeds_; that is, 800 on one
_Partition_: which being multiplied by 10 (the number of _Partitions_)
makes 8000; and 8000 again by 4 (the number of _Heads_) makes 32000
_Seeds_, the yearly product of that _Plant_.

2. §. So in _Typha major_, the _Seeds_ being blow’n off and sow’n
(as the Eggs of many _Fishes_ spawn’d) with great hazard, they are
strangely numerous. For as they stand altogether upon the _Spike_, they
make a _Cylinder_ at least six Inches long, and near ⅝ᵗʰˢ of an Inch in
Diametre, or an Inch and ¾ about. Now 9 of these _Seeds_, set side to
side, as they stand on the _Spike_, make but ⅛ᵗʰ of an Inch; so that
72 make a line of an Inch in Length. But because upon the _Spike_, the
_Hairs_ belonging to the _Seeds_ come between them; we will abate 10,
and count but 62. To which ¾ᵗʰˢ of 62, that is (without the Fraction)
46 being added, makes 108 for the Circuit of the _Cylinder_. And the
_Cylinder_ being six Inches long, there are six times 62, that is, 372,
for a Line the length of the _Cylinder_. Which number being multiplied
by 108, produceth 40176 the number of _Seeds_ which stand upon one
_Stalk_; and so, upon three _Stalks_, which one _Plant_ commonly bears,
there are in one year, above a hundred and twenty Thousand _Seeds_.


3. §. SO SOON as the _Seed_ is ripe, Nature taketh several _Methods_
for its being duly sow’n: not only in the opening of the _Uterus_, as
in some Instances[69] hath already been seen; but also in the make of
the _Seed_ it self. For _First_, the _Seeds_ of many _Plants_, which
affect a peculiar _Soil_ or _Seat_, as of _Arum_, _Poppy_, &c. are
heavy and small enough, without further care, to fall directly down
into the Ground: and so to grow in the same place where themselves had
their _Birth_.

     [69] _P. 3. Ch. 5. Tab. 70, & 71._

4. §. But if they are so large and light, as to be exposed to the wind,
they are often furnished with one or more _Hooks_; To stay them from
straying over far from their proper place, till by the fall of _Leavs_
or otherwise, they are safely lodged. So the _Seeds_ of _Avens_ have
one single _Hook_, those of _Agrimony_ and _Goose-grass_, many; ♦ _Tab.
72._ ♦ both the former, loving a _Bank_ for warmth, the latter, a
_Hedge_ for its support.

5. §. On the contrary, many _Seeds_ are furnished with _Wings_ or
_Feathers_. Partly, with the help of the Wind to carry them, when they
are ripe, from off the _Plant_, as those of _Ash_, _Maple_, _Orach_,
&c. lest staying thereon too long, they should either be corrupted, or
miss their season. And partly, to enable them to make their flight,
more or less, abroad: that so they may not, by falling together, come
up too thick; and that if one should miss a good _Soyl_ or _Bed_,
another may hit. So the _Kernels_ of _Pine_ have wings not unlike to
those of some _Insects_; yet very short, in respect of the weight of
the _Seed_; ♦ _Tab. 72._ ♦ whereby they flye not in the _Aer_, but like
domestick _Fowls_, only flutter upon the Ground. But those of _Typha_,
_Dandelion_ and most of the _Pappous_ kind, with many more, have very
long and numerous _Feathers_, by which they are wafted every way, and
to any distance necessary for the aforesaid purposes.

6. §. Again, there are some _Seeds_, which are scattered not by flying
abroad, but by being either _Spurted_, or _Slung_ away. The first are
those of _Woodsorrel_; which having a running _Root_, Nature sees it
fit to sow the _Seeds_ at some distance. The doing of which is effected
by a white thick and sturdy _Cover_ of a _Tendinous_ or _Springy
Nature_, in which the _Seed_ lies within the _Case_. ♦ _Tab. 72._ ♦
This _Cover_, so soon as it begins to drye, bursts open on one side, in
an instant, and is violently turned inside outward, as you would turn
the _Gizard_ of a _Fowl_; and so smartly throws off the _Seed_.

7. §. The _Seeds_ of _Harts-tongue_, and of all that _Tribe_, are
_Slung_ or _Shot_ away. The doing of which is performed by the curious
contrivance of the _Seed-Case_; as in _Codded Arsmart_, and some other
like _Plants_. Only there, the _Spring_ moves and curles up inward; but
here it moves outward. I shall describe it, as well as the _Weather_
(which when I observed it was cloudy) would permit. Every _Seed-Case_,
as it appears through a good _Glass_, ♦ _Tab. 72._ ♦ stands upon a
_Pedicle_ from ½ an Inch to an Inch or more in Length; at the bottom
about as thick again as a _Horse-hair_, and a little thicker at the
_Top_, on which stands the _Case_, of a _Silver Colour_; about the
bigness of a _Cherry-Stone_, of a _Spherick Figure_, and girded
about with a sturdy _Tendon_ or _Spring_, of the _Colour_ of _Gold_:
the whole _Machine_ looking not much unlike a little _Padlock_. The
_Surface_ of the _Spring_ resembles a fine _Screw_, or some of the
_Aer-Vessels_ in the _Wood_ of a _Plant_. So soon as by the _Innate
Aer_ of the _Plant_, or otherwise, this _Spring_ is become stark
enough, it suddenly breaks the _Case_ into two halfs, like two little
_Cups_, and so slings the _Seed_.

8. §. These _Cases_ grow in oblique _Furrows_ or _Trenches_ on the back
side the _Leaf_, from ¼ of an Inch to an Inch in Length, and about ⅛ᵗʰ
of an Inch broad. ♦ _Tab. 72._ ♦ In one of these _Trenches_ an Inch
long are more than 300 of the _Cases_ above described; and allowing but
10 _Seeds_ to every _Case_, above 3000 _Seeds_. Which being multiplied
by the number of _Furrows_ in one _Leaf_, with allowance for the lesser
_Furrows_; and that summ by the number of _Leaves_ commonly growing
upon one _Root_, comes to above Ten Hundred Thousand _Seeds_, the
annual product of this _Plant_. The _Seed_ is of a _Tawny Colour_,
through a good _Glass_ about 1/12ᵗʰ of an Inch long, flat, and somewhat
oval. Of these, ten Thousand are not so big as a white _Pepper Corn_.

        _Of the several COVERS of_ Seeds, _and of the VITELLUM._


THE next step of _Natures Managery_, relates chiefly to the Growth of
the _Seed_ when it is sow’n. For which purpose, the outer _Covers_
are somewhere furnished with _Apertures_ sufficient for the reception
of _Alimental Moysture_ from the _Ground_; and _Divisions_, for the
_shooting forth_ of the young _Root_ into it. As in the _Seed_ of
a _Gourd_, at the _Bottom_; in a _Bean_, on the _Side_; and in a
_Chestnut_, at the _Top_: ♦ _Tab. 72._ ♦ in which places the _Radicle_
or young _Root_ always lies and puts forth, in the said several
_Seeds_. And the _Seed_ of _Palma Christi_; ♦ _Tab. 72._ ♦ which
falls to the Ground not only in the usual _Covers_, but also in the
_Seed-Case_, for the more plentiful admission of _Aliment_, hath a
double _Aperture_. Not much unlike to this, is that found sometimes in
larger parcels of _Euphorbium_; for which _Cause_, I suspect it to be
the _Gumm_ of a _Plant_ of the _Tithymal_ kind.

2. §. If the _Cover_ of the _Seed_ be stony and very hard, it is also
distinguished into several _Pieces_; whereby they easily cleave asunder
without much resistance to the eruption of the _Root_. So the _Shell_
of a _Hazel-nut_ easily cleavs on the edg; and the cleft begins best at
the poynt, where the _Root_ stands and shoots forth. ♦ _Tab. 75._ ♦ The
_Shell_ of some _Walnuts_ cleavs into three _Parts_; and the _Stone_
of the _Bellerick Myrobalan_ into five: that so, being very thick and
hard, if one piece should not yield, another may not fail to do it. And
the _Covers_ or _Husks_ of some sorts of _Grain_, as of _Millet_, are
only folded or laped one over another, the better to give way to their
tender _Sprouts_.

3. §. Besides the _Kernels_ of _Plums_ and some other _Fruits_, there
are very many _Seeds_, even of the smaller sort, which have also stony
_Covers_; as of _Carthamum_, _Myagrum monospermon_, _Beet_, _Borage_,
_Lithosperme_, _Amaranthus_, _Violet_, &c. Sometimes, for the reception
of the harsher and less matured _Principles_ from the _Seed_, in its
_Generation_, as in _Borage_. Commonly, to keep it warmer before and
after its sow’n. For which purpose, the outer _Covers_ of some _Seeds_,
are as it were Lined with _Fur_: in that of _Great Maple_, Short; of
_Gossipium_, Long. And if the _Seed_ requires a longer stay under
ground, the hardness of the _Cover_ serves to stint the _Aliment_; lest
too much, should either rot it, or cause it to germinate, before its
proper season, or full time for a more _Masculine_ Growth.

4. §. On the contrary, many _Seeds_, as those of _Clary_,
_Garden-Cress_, and others of that _Tribe_, have their upper _Covers_
faced with a _Mucilage_: which being easily receptive of any _Moysture_
in the Ground, gradually swells, till it lies like a _Gelly_ round
about the _Seed_. Either for a more plentiful supply of _Aliment_; or
at least, to soften the _Covers_, the better to accelerate the Growth
of the _Seed_.

5. §. The process of Nature in the several steps of the _Vegetation_ of
the _Seed_, hath formerly been explained.[70]

     [70] _B. 1. Ch. 1._


6. §. THE COVERS of all, or at least the far greater number of _Seeds_,
are Three; some way or other derived from the _Pith_: as shall
hereafter be seen. And sometimes, Four: even those of ston’d _Fruits_,
have Three, besides the _Stone_. In that of _Gossipium_, there are Two
_Coats_ under that lined with the _Cotton_. The _Seeds_ of _Cucumer_,
_Goats-beard_, _Broom_, _Scabious_, _Lettice_, &c. although so small,
have plainly Three _Coats_. ♦ _Tab. 75._ ♦ But in some of these, and
many more, there are only Two distinctly visible, except in the State
of _Generation_.

7. §. In the Upper _Coat_, the _Seed-Vessels_ are disseminated.
The Second, is first a meer _Pulp_; but afterwards shrinks up and
sticks close to the upper. The Third or Inmost is more dense; and
if it be thin, for the most part, transparent; whereby the _Seed_
seems sometimes to be naked while it lies therein; as in _Almonds_,
_Cucumers_, and the like. ♦ _Tab. 76._ ♦ For this sticks not to the
midle _Coat_, as that doth to the outer; but commonly, remains entire,
after those are stripp’d off, being as it were, the _Smock_ of the
_Seed_.

8. §. In _Melissa_ and some other small _Seeds_, it comes finely off
upon soaking in warm Water or on the _Tongue_. In _Fenugreek_, ’tis
soft, and of an _Amber-Colour_; and being moystened, looks almost
like fine _Glew_. But commonly, ’tis a pretty tough _Membrane_, and
often with some thickness, as in _Plums_, _Borage_, _Scabious_. Yet
always extream thin at the _Tip_ of the _Radicle_; the more easily
to break and yield to it, as the _Secundine_ to the _Fœtus_, when it
first shoots into the Ground. And sometimes, as in the _Seeds_ of an
_Orange_, it hath at one end, the resemblance of a _Placenta_. ♦ _Tab.
75._ ♦ But of this, and the two upper _Coats_, I shall give a further
Description in the last _Chapter_.


9. §. AS ALL _Seeds_ are _ex Ovo_; so there are many with thin
_Covers_, as of _Orach_, _Spinage_, _Beet_, and the rest of that
_Tribe_, &c. which besides the _Albumen_ or clear _Liquor_ out of
which they are bred; have also, a _Vitellum_, or a _Body_ thereunto
_Analogous_: being neither part of the _Seed_, nor part of the
_Covers_, but distinct from them both. With respect to the _Bulk_ of
the _Seed_, very large, as white as _Starch_, and pretty friable,
like good _Rice_ or _Barley_: ♦ _Tab. 75._ ♦ of a roundish _Figure_,
and grooved on the _Girth_, so as to have a double _Edge_; Whereby
the _Seed_, which is long and slender, lies round it, as a _Sack_ of
_Corn_ upon a _Pack-Saddle_ or a _Rope_ upon a _Pully-wheel_. Upon my
first notice hereof, it seemed to answer to a _Placenta_. But upon
further consideration, the _Analogy_ doth not hold betwixt them. For
the _Placenta_ lies without the _Membranes_ in which the _Fœtus_ is
conteined: whereas this body lies within the _Covers_ contiguous to the
_Seed_, and so becomes its first and finest _Aliment_, as the _Yelk_
doth to the _Chick_. For which purpose, as in the _Generation_ of the
_Seed_, it is a pure _Milky Chyle_; So in its _Vegetation_, it is
converted into the like again.

10. §. The same Body for Sustenance is observable in the _Seeds_ of
_Rhapontick_, _Dock_, _Sorrel_, and the rest of that kindred, with this
difference; ♦ _Tab. 75._ ♦ That whereas in _Orach_, &c. the _Seed_
only lies upon it; here, the main _Body_ or _Lobes_ of the _Seed_ are
immersed therein, the _Radicle_ standing naked or above it. So that the
said _Lobes_, and therein the _Seminal-Root_ are beded herein, as in a
_Tub_ of _Meal_ or a little pot of pure refin’d _Mould_, necessary for
the first _Vegetation_ of the _Radicle_.


11. §. BY THESE midle _Steps_, _Nature_ proceeds from the _Thiner
Covers_ of _Seeds_; or those, which after the _Generation_ of the
_Seed_ is finished, shrink up; to the _Bulky Kind_, or those which
keep their _Bulk_ after they are dry. Wherein, not only the _Lobes_,
as in _Dock_, but the whole _Seed_ is immediately lodged. Different in
_Substance_, _Shape_ and _Bulk_; but always many times biger than the
true _Seed_ within it: for which it is commonly mistaken; but is no
more the _Seed_, than is the _Stone_ of a _Plum_, the _Kernel_.

12. §. In the _Barbado Nut_, ’tis _White_, _Soft_, _Conick-oval_, and
taking all its _Dimensions_, 8 or 10 times bigger than the _Seed_
within it. In _Ashen Keys_, ’tis of a sad _Colour_, _hard_, yet
somewhat _Oyly_, _Oval_ and _flat_, and of the same _Bigness_ as in
the _Barbado Nut_, with respect to the _Seed_. ♦ _Tab. 76._ ♦ In the
_Fruit_ commonly called _Nux Vomica Officinarum_, ’tis of the _Colour_
and _Hardness_ of a _Cows-Horne_; and makes almost the whole _Body_
of the _Fruit_, being about 14 or 15 times the _Bulk_ of the _Seed_.
♦ _Tab. 77._ ♦ In _Goosgrass_ or _Cliver_ ’tis of the like _Horny
Substance_, but shaped somewhat like a _Bonet_ with the _Rimm_ tuckt
in. And so in a _Coffee-Berry_; but rowled or foulded up into a kind of
_Oval Figure_, with a _Notch_ or _Rima_ through the Length, where the
two _Ends_ meet. With other diversities which will best be understood,
when I come presently to the _Description_ of the _Seed_ herein
contained.

13. §. With respect to the use of this _Cover_, it is observable, that
where there is a _Stone_ or _Shell_ over it, as in the _Barbado Nut_,
it is _soft_; but where there is none, as in _Nux Vomica_, _Ash_,
&c. ’tis hard; and so it self instead of a _Stone_. As also, That it
becomes _hard_, only by the proper Nature of its _Parenchyma_, and the
exquisite _smallness_ of the _Bladders_ of which it consists. Whereas
a _Stone_, is also hardened by the _Lees_ or _Tartar_ of the _Sap_
which sinks into it, and thereby _petrifies_ it[71] as hath been said.
So that whereas a _Stone_, as it lies in the _Ground_, only cleavs in
certain Places, but continues hard: This _Cover_, like some _Horns_,
upon the due accession of _Moisture_, doth gradually become _soft_.
Whereby, as while it is _hard_, it performs the Office of a _Stone_,
in guarding the _Seed_ til the proper _Season_ for its _Growth_: So
afterwards when it is _soft_, it answers, as in _Orach_ or _Dock_,[72]
to a _Vitellum_, from whence the _Seed_ receiveth its first and purest
_Aliment_.

                                CHAP. IV.

              _Of the FOETUS or true SEED: and first of the
                           RADICLE and LOBES._


HAVING discoursed of the _Covers_, I come next to the _Seed_ or _Fœtus_
it self. Of the _Shape_ and _Posture_ whereof, I shall give some
_Examples_, first, among those with the thinner sort of _Covers_; and
then, of those with the _Bulky_ one: where I shall speak only of the
_Lobes_, or _Main Body_, and the _Radicle_. Next, I shall describe the
several sorts of _Nodes_ or _Buds_ of _Seeds_. And lastly, the several
Parts, of which the _Lobes_, _Radicle_, and _Buds_ are compounded.

2. §. Among _Seeds_ with the _Thinner Covers_, are those of all sorts
of _Corn_ and _Grass_. Of a different make, from that of most other
_Seeds_: The _Main Body_ being not divided into _Lobes_, but one
entire Piece, doubled in the form of a Pair of _Lips_. And whereas
commonly, the whole _Seed_ is very _Soft_ and _Oyly_; here, only those
two minute _Parts_, which become the _Root_ and _Stalk_, are so: The
_Main Body_ being of a different Substance; when the _Corn_ is ripe,
_hard_ and _friable_; but when it is sown, easily _colliquable_ into a
kind of _Milk_ or _Chyle_, so that, in some respects, it hath a near
_Analogy_ to a _Vitellum_. For as that is gradually melted into a sort
of _Chyle_, and by the _Branches_ of the _Ductus Intestinalis_ carryed
into the _Bowels_ of the _Chick_: So is this, into a like _Substance_,
and by the _Branches_ of the _Seminal Root_ (formerly describ’d)
conveyed to those _Parts_, which become the future Plant. ♦ _B. 1. Ch.
1._ ♦

3. §. Of Relation to this Kind, the _Seeds_ of _Dates_, and of some
other like _Plants_, may be esteem’d. For that which is commonly called
the _Stone_, seems indeed to be the _Main Body_ of the _Seed_, doubled
or folded up in the same manner as in _Corn_. To which that _Part_
which becomes the _Plant_, is annexed. ♦ _Tab. 75._ ♦ But whereas in
_Corn_, ’tis placed at the Bottom of the _Main Body_; here it lies
in a small round _Cavity_ in the middle of the _Back_. The _Stone_,
or _Main Body_, where this Part grows to it, is not so hard, as more
remote from it: and is therefore probably in some part dissolved, by
lying in the _Ground_, as in _Corn_.

4. §. But for the most part, the _Main Body_ is divided, as hath been
said, into two _Lobes_; and those in Substance _Homogeneous_ to the
other _Part_ or _Parts_, plainly distinguished in most _Kernels_ and
other large _Seeds_; ♦ _Tab. 75._ ♦ and not difficultly in many lesser
ones, as in that of _Viola Lunaris_, _Scabious_, _Doves-Foot_, &c. if
slipped out of their _Covers_ before they are full ripe.

5. §. In _Hounds-Tongue_, they are of a circular figure, and very large
in Proportion to the _Radicle_. In _Cucumer_, oblong, with some visible
_Branches_ of the _Seminal Root_; and the _Radicle_ somewhat bigger. ♦
_Tab. 75._ ♦ But in _Scorzonera_, very long, like the Leggs of a Pair
of _Compasses_: and the two first, or _dissimilar Leavs_ of the _Plant_
into which they are converted, are of the same _Shape_. Of these and
many more, the _Radicle_ is short and pointed; and lies in one straight
Line with the _Lobes_.

6. §. In _Viola Lunaria_, they are very large; and the _Branches_
of the _Seminal Root_, fairly apparent, so as to resemble a Pair of
_Leavs_. The _Radicle_ pretty long, equally thick from end to end, and
couched down upon the two _Lobes_, ♦ _Tab. 75._ ♦ each of them having
a little _Shoulder_ for it to lie upon. In _Woad_, where it hath the
like _Posture_ and _Shape_, as also in _Chamælina_, _Eruca_, and many
others, it is very _Bulky_, being bigger than both the _Lobes_ put
together.

7. §. Of this Part, I think it may be observed, That commonly those
_Seeds_, wherein it is very small with respect to the _Lobes_, produce
a _Perennial_ Plant: And so, _vice versa_, where it is very large, an
_Annual_ one. In the latter, the _Seminal Virtue_ being more vigorous,
and so tending more hastily to the Business of _Generation_, followed
with the _Death_ of the Plant.


8. §. IN THE former _Seeds_, the _Lobes_ lie flat one against another.
♦ _Tab. 75._ ♦ But in _Garden-Radish_, they are folded up, so as to
receive the _Radicle_ into their _Bosome_: as when a _Chicken_ tucks
his Head under his Wing.

9. §. In _Holyoak_, the _Lobes_ are plated upwards, and re-plated down
again. ♦ _Tab. 75._ ♦ Being most agreeably composed to the _Shape_ of
the _Covers_, as those are to their _Posture_ on the Plant. In _Maple_,
they are plated one over another, and so rouled up.

10. §. In the _Cotton-Seed_, which consisteth almost wholly of two very
broad and thin _Lobes_ or _Leaves_, the _Folds_ are yet more numerous;
♦ _Tab. 75._ ♦ all curiously reduced to an exact and solid _Oval_.

11. §. It happens now and then, that instead of two, there are three
_Lobes_, as in the _Kernels_ of _Plums_, _Apples_, and other _Fruits_,
and the smaller sorts of _Seeds_, will spring up sometimes with more
than two _dissimilar Leaves_, originally the _Lobes_ of the _Seed_.
These are observed by some, more frequently to produce a double
_Flower_, which may be, because the _Seminal Virtue_ in such _Seeds_,
is increased by a third Part.


12. §. IN many _Seeds_, the _Radicle_ is of one and the same _Colour_
from end to end. But in others, as in the _Lupine_, it is observable,
That the upper and greater half, is _White_; the Lower to the _Point_,
hath a kind of _Horny Gloss_, and seems to be of a somewhat different
make. ♦ _Tab. 75._ ♦ Whereby it comes to pass, that after the _Radicle_
is shot forth a little way, only this lower half descends and becomes
the _Root_: The upper half is produced or raised above ground, as a
_Pillar_ upon which the _Lobes_, or _dissimilar Leaves_ are erected.

13. §. This _Seed_, on the out side of each _Lobe_, and near the
_Radicle_, hath a very small and round _Node_, like a _Navel_; whereof,
in the first Book: the whole _Seed_ looking not much unlike a _Pidgeons
Head_; ♦ _Ch. 7._ ♦ the _Radicle_ resembling the _Bill_, and the
_Navel_ the _Eye_.


14. §. IN the _Seed_ of _Garden-Orach_, ♦ _Tab. 75._ ♦ both the
_Radicle_ and _Lobes_ are very long and slender, and lie almost in
a compleat Circle round about the _Vitellum_ before describ’d. The
_Lobes_ of _Rhapontick_ are shaped like the _Bitt_ of a _Spade_; ♦ _Ch.
3._ ♦ and the _Radicle_ stands erected above them like the _Handle_.


15. §. OF SEEDS also with the _Bulky Cover_, there are many not divided
into _Lobes_; being in a manner, all one _Piece_; as all of the
_Bulbous-Kind_. In some of which, though the inmost _Cover_ be thin;
yet compared either with the other _Covers_, or with the _Seed_ it
self, it may very well be accounted of the _Bulky Kind_.

16. §. In _Flag_, it is above twenty times bigger than the _Seed_
within it. Consisting of _Bladders_ all _Radiated_ towards the _Seat_
of the _Seed_. The _Seed_ it self is shaped somewhat like a _Penknife_.
♦ _Tab. 76._ ♦ The lower Part which becomes the _Bulb_, as the _Haft_,
is thick, and cometh near to a _Cylindrick_ Figure, and the end, round.
The upper Part which becomes the first years _Leaf_, as the _Blade_, is
rather flat, double edged, and pointed, and the Point a little bent.
The _Fibers_ and _Bladders_ of which it consists, are all disposed into
Parallel Lines running by the length. In _Lily_, where this _Cover_ is
thinner and more _Transparent_, without being cut, but only held up
against the Light, the _Seed_ may be seen within it.


17. §. BUT THE greater number of _Seeds_ also with the _Bulky Cover_,
are divided into two _Lobes_; which, for the most part, resemble a pair
of little _Leavs_. In the _Purging Nut_ of _Angola_, the _Shell_ being
taken off, the upper _Covers_ (dry’d and shrunk up) seem to be but
one. ♦ _Tab. 76._ ♦ In these, the _Spermatick Vessels_ are Branched.
Under these, lies the Thick and Inmost _Cover_; which being cut down
the middle, exhibits the true _Seed_: Consisting of a couple of fair
_Leavs_, Veined, and as white as _Milk_, joyned together with the
_Radicle_ at their _Base_; and let into a Hollow, made in the _Cover_,
of an answerable shape. The like is observable in the _Barbado-Nut_,
_Ricinus Americanus_, and some other _Indian Fruits_; with some little
difference in the Shape of the _Root_ and _Leavs_.


18. §. IN the foregoing _Fruits_, the _Bulky Cover_ is very soft. But
in the _Nux Vomica Officinarum_, ’tis near as hard as a _Date-Stone_.
♦ _Tab. 76._ ♦ In this, besides the hollow made for the reception of
the _Seed_, or the two _Leavs_ and _Root_; the _Sides_ are separated or
distinct almost to the _Edge_ of the _Cover_ round about, especially
towards the _Root_: So that it may not unaptly be compared to a little
_Pouch_ with the _Sides_ clapt together.


19. §. IN this and the _Nuts_ above mentioned,the _Seeds_ are all very
large. But in some other _Plants_, they are extream small, so as to be
hardly visible without a _Glass_; ♦ _Tab. 77._ ♦ as in _Staphisagria_,
_Peony_, &c. In _Staphisagria_, the _Thick_ or _Inmost Cover_, is
commonly a _Spherical Triangle_, _conick_ towards the _Base_. At the
poynt of which, there is a little _Cavity_, in which the _Seed_, about
as big as a small pins head, is lodged. The _Root_ whereof is a little
poynted, and the two _Lobes_ rounded at the _Top_.

20. §. In _Peony_, the same _Cover_ is _Soft_, _White_, and of an _Oval
Figure_; ♦ _Tab. 77._ ♦ the part used in _Medicine_. Usually thought
to be the _Seed_ it self. But is near two hundred times biger than the
true _Seed_, which is almost invisible. It lies in a little _Cavity_
near the bottom of the _Cover_; with a thick and blunt _Root_, and two
poynted _Lobes_ or _Leavs_.


21. §. IN the _Coffee-Berry_, the _Seed_ lies in the _Inner_ or
_Cartilaginous Cover_ (formerly described) ♦ _Ch. 3._ ♦ where one would
not expect to find it, _sc._ near the _Top_ or _Surface_ of the _Back_.
♦ _Tab. 77._ ♦ The _Lobes_ of the _Seed_ are veined like two very
minute _Leaves_, and joyned to a long _Root_ like a _Stalk_. The end
of which comes just to the bottom of the _Cover_, ready for its _exit_
into the _Ground_.

22. §. In _Goosgrass_, where the _Inner Cover_ is also _Cartilaginous_
or _Horney_, ♦ _Tab. 77._ ♦ the _Seed_ is postured in much a like
manner, and looks just like a couple of poynted _Leavs_ with a very
long _Stalk_.


23. §. THE _Seed_ of _Stramonium_, is also inclosed in a _Bulky Cover_.
Which being soaked in warm water, and very warily cut about the edges,
with a _Rasor_, the _Seed_ may be taken out of it entire. ♦ _Tab. 77._
♦ Shaped like that of _Orach_, but much longer. For the _Reception_
whereof, the _Cover_ is formed with a hollow, which runs round about it
near the _Edge_; where in the _Seed_ lies like a little winding _Snake_.




                                CHAP. V.

              _Of the BUDS of_ Seeds. _And of the PARTS, of
        which these, the_ Radicle, _and_ Lobes _are compounded._


FROM between the two _Lobes_, rises up the _Stalk_ of the _Plant_. The
original whereof, either to the naked _Eye_, or by a good _Glass_, is
always visible in the _Seed_.

2. §. In many _Plants_, _Nature_ sees fit only to lay the foundation
hereof in a small round _Node_; where upon the _Leavs_, in the
_Vegetation_ of the _Seed_, are superstructed: as in _Viola Lunaria_,
and others.

3. §. But in the greater number of _Seeds_, is formed a true _Bud_,
consisting of perfect _Leavs_; different from those, which grow upon
the _Stalk_, only in _Bigness_; and so far in _Shape_, as the same
_Parts_ of an Animal _Fœtus_, in its several ages in the _Womb_. In
many _Seeds_, as well small as great, and as well of _Herbs_ as
_Trees_, it is very apparent. But oftentimes lyeth so deep between the
_Lobes_ as to be almost undiscernable, as in _Maple_.

4. §. The _Leaves_ of the _Bud_, in different _Plants_, are of a
different _Number_; in some, Two; in others, Four, Six, and sometimes
more. In the _Bay-Berry_, they are only two; very small, but thick or
fat, and finely veined. In the _Seed_ of _Carduus Benedictus_, ♦ _Tab.
78._ ♦ they are also Two; almost invisible; broad at the _Bottom_,
poynted at the _Top_, thick or fat, yet plated inward, and postured a
little distant one from the other; for the two next to rise up between
them. The like may be seen in _Carthamum_; and so, I suppose, in all
the _Carduus Kind_.

5. §. In some _Herbs_, although the _Bud_ consisteth but of two
perfect _Leaves_, yet they are very conspicuous. ♦ _Tab. 78._ ♦ Not
only in larger _Seeds_, as in the _Phaseolus_ or _French Bean_; but in
those which are small, as in the _Seed_ of _Hemp_. In this, the two
_Leaves_ are both plated, and so set _Edge_ to _Edge_, with mutual
_Undulations_. Of that Length, as to be extended beyond a third part of
the _Lobes_.

6. §. In the _Seed_ of _Sena_, the _Bud_ consisteth of Four _Leaves_;
♦ _Tab. 78._ ♦ of which, the greater pair is the outer, and guards the
less. Shaped not much unlike those in the _Seed_ of _Carduus_; but are
a little more visible.

7. §. In the _Bud_ of an _Almond_, we may easily count six, or eight
_Leaves_, and sometimes more; the Inermost being laid bare by a
dexterous _Separation_ of the Outer. ♦ _Tab. 78._ ♦ These are by much
the greatest, doubled Inward, and so laped one over another; whereby
they embosome all the rest, as a _Hen_ spreads her _Wings_ over her
_Chickens_. The like is observable in many other large _Kernels_, as
also in the _Garden Bean_, and some other _Plants_. With respect to
which, I have taken leave[73] to call this _Part_ the _Plume_.

     [73] _B. 1. Ch. 1._


8. §. THE LOBES of the _Seed_, and so likewise the _Radicle_ and _Bud_
consist of a _Skin_, _Parenchyma_, and _Branched Vessels_: all which I
have formerly described.[74] I shall now add the following _Remarques_.

     [74] _B. 1. Ch. 1._

♦ _Tab. 79._ ♦ 9. §. And first of the _Skin_, which in some _Seeds_,
as the _French-Bean_ may easily be separated from the _Parenchyma_:
especially if the _Bean_ be soaked in water for some days; for then it
will slip off, like the _Skin_ in any part of ones _Body_ where it is
blistered. ’Tis woven into _Bladders_, as the _Parenchyma_; but into
smaller ones, and upon the _Lobes_ of a _Garden Bean_, all radiated
towards the _Center_. With these _Bladders_, there are also mixed a
sort of _Lignous Fibres_, incomparably small, which give a _Toughness_
to the _Skin_, and by which the _Bladders_ are directed into _Rays_.

10. §. The _Bladders_ of the _Parenchyma_, as is said, are much larger
than those of the _Skin_, especially in the _Lobes_. In those of a
_Garden Bean_, somewhat oval, about ⅛ of an Inch Diametre by their
_Bredth_, ♦ _Tab. 79._ ♦ and directed towards the _Branches_ of the
_Seminal Root_. In the _Radicle_, they are twenty times smaller, than
in the _Lobes_: and so in the _Plume_.

11. §. Throughout the _Parenchyma_ run the _Branched Vessels_, ♦ _Tab.
79._ ♦ which in the _Lobes_ make the _Seminal Root_; in the _Radicle_
and _Plume_, the _Wood_ of the _Root_ and _Stalk_. In all of them,
distributed as hath been[75] formerly shewed.

     [75] _B. 1. Ch. 1._

12. §. I shall here further note, That the utmost divisions are no
where extended to the Circumference of the _Lobes_, ♦ _Tab. 79._ ♦ but
are all inosculated together at a considerable distance from it, as in
the _Leaves_ of some _Plants_.

13. §. In the _Lobes_ they all meet in one solid _Nerve_. But in the
_Radicle_, are dilated into a hollow _Trunk_, filled up with a _Pith_;
composed of _Bladders_ somewhat bigger than those which make, as it
were, the _Barque_ of the _Radicle_. ♦ _Tab. 79._ ♦ In the _Radicle_ of
a _French Bean_, the _Pith_ is very conspicuous.

14. §. The _Vessels_ are of two kinds, as in the other _Parts_ of
a _Plant_; for _Sap_, and for _Aer_. Not running collateral, as
_Arteries_ and _Veins_; but the latter every where sheathed in the
former. From the _Aer-Vessels_ it is, that if a _Bean_ be steeped in
water, and then the _Radicle_ cut transversly and pressed, it will
yield _Bubles_ as well as _Liquor_. ♦ _Tab. 79._ ♦ These _Vessels_ are
admirably small, yet through a very good _Glass_ become visible.

15. §. The _Liquor_ conteined in the _Seed_, when full ripe is chiefly
_Oyl_; generally, found in a greater proportion here, than in any
other part of a _Plant_. Being as the _Pickle_, in which the _Seminal
Virtues_, _i. e._ the more _volatile_ and _active Principles_ of the
_Seed_, are immersed for their _Preservation_: and to curb them from
too great a _Luxuriance_ in the _Vegetation_ of the _Seed_.




                                CHAP. VI.

                    _Of the GENERATION of the SEED._

AS I made choice of a _Garden-Bean_, to shew the manner of the
_Vegetation_ of the _Seed_: so I shall take an _Aprecock_, as very apt
and convenient, to observe and represent the _Method_ which _Nature_
taketh in its _Generation_.

2. §. In order to do this, the first thing that is to be done, is
to make a fit _Uterus_. Both to keep the _Membranes_ of the _Fœtus_
warm, and succulent, till it be formed: and to preserve and secure the
_Fœtus_ it self afterwards, till it comes to be born into the _Ground_.

3. §. For this purpose, the _Pulp_ and _Stone_ of the _Fruit_ are both
necessary; but primarily the _Stone_: the _Meat_ or _Pulp_ being no
otherwise necessary, but because the _Stone_ cannot be made without
it; the petrifying of that _Parenchyma_ which is the _Ground_ of the
_Stone_, being effected, by the sinking or the _Tartar_ from the _Pulp_
thereinto.

4. §. And that, at the first, the _Ground_ of the _Stone_, is a
distinct, but soft _Parenchyma_; is evident in the cuting of a young
_Aprecock_. Of which, also a slice cut off, with a _Rasor_, and viewed
through a good _Glass_, sheweth it to be composed of _Bladders_, as
the _Pulp_ it self. ♦ _Tab. 82._ ♦ Only, whereas many of those of the
_Pulp_ are large, now about as big as a white _Pepper-Corn_: these are
no bigger than a _Mustard-Seed_. But as the _Parenchyma_ hardens into a
_Stone_, these _Bladders_ are all gradually filled up, and disappear.

5. §. This _Parenchyma_ is derived immediately from the _Pith_, as
the _Pulp_ is from the _Barque_; and makes the far greater part of
the _Stone_. ’Tis covered all over within, with a very thin _Lining_;
derived, not from the _Pith_ but the _Parenchyma_ which covers the
_Seed-Branch_, upon its first entrance within the hollow of the
_Stone_. This _Lining_ is of a close substance; yet composed of
_Bladders_, exquisitely small and hardly visible. By which means, it
soon becomes a very hard and dry _Body_; ♦ _Tab. 80._ ♦ and is hereby
fitted, both to promote the induration of the rest of the _Stone_; and
the seasonable drying, and so, the shrinking up, of the _Covers_ of the
_Seed_, to make room for its _Growth_.

6. §. The _Stone_ being made hard and dry; it could never be so
sufficiently softned by lying under ground, but that, it would keep
the _Seed_ a perpetual prisoner, unless it were also made pretty
easily to cleave in two. For which purpose, the _Skin_ of the _Fruit_
doth observably conduce. ♦ _Tab. 80._ ♦ For in a _Slice_ of a young
_Aprecock_ cut transversly with a very sharp knife, it may be seen,
especially with the help of a _Glass_, to be doubled inward from the
two _Lips_ of the _Fruit_, and so to be continued, not only through
the _Pulp_, but also through the _Stone_ it self, into the hollow of
the same, where it meets, and is united with the _Lining_ thereof.
Whereby, as it further helps to the drying and hardning of the _Stone_;
so also renders it cleavable in that part, where it runs through it.
And therefore, whereas towards the _Stalk_, it goes no farther than to
the _Seed-Branch_, and so but half way through the _Stone_: towards the
_Top_ of the _Fruit_, where the _Radicle_ stands, and where the _Stone_
begins to cleave, it runs quite through it.

7. §. _Nature_ having thus provided a convenient _Uterus_, She next
taketh care about the _Membranes_ of the _Fœtus_. These are _Three_
apparently distinct, and in many respects different one from another.

8. §. The outer _Membrane_ is derived from the _Parenchyma_ which
surrounds the _Seed-Branch_; which, upon its entry into the hollow of
the _Stone_, is expanded, as it were, into two _Bladders_, one within
another; ♦ _Tab. 80._ ♦ whereof, one becomes the _Lining_ of the
_Stone_; the other, this outer _Membrane_: as is best seen by cuting a
young _Aprecock_, when it is about half an Inch long, down through the
midle, or from the _Seat_ of the _Flower_ to the _Stalk_, between the
two _Lips_.

9. §. This outer _Membrane_, at this age, hath a good full and frim
_Body_, about 1/12ᵗʰ of an Inch thick, or through an ordinary _Glass_,
half an Inch, where it is thickest, as at the _Sides_ and the greater
end: the _Poynt_ being thinner, for the more easy eruption of the
_Radicle_ into the _Earth_. ♦ _Tab. 80._ ♦ Composed of _Bladders_,
through an ordinary _Glass_, about as big, as a _Colewort-Seed_.

10. §. Throughout this _Membrane_, the _Vessels_ conteined in the
_Seed-Branch_ are distributed. Beginning a little below the smaller end
of the _Coat_ or _Membrane_, they thence fetch their circuit both ways
round about, just beneath the _Surface_ of the _Membrane_, and at last,
meet in the midle of the greater end, where they are all inosculated,
so as to make a kind of _umbilical Node_. ♦ _Tab. 80._ ♦ From whence
they strike deeper into it, and at last, into the midle _Membrane_,
in which they presently become invisible. By these _Vessels_, the
_Sap_ is brought and spewed into the midle _Membrane_. So that the
outer _Membrane_ seemeth, in some respects, to be answerable to the
_Placenta_ in _Animals_.

11. §. The midle _Membrane_, is derived from the bottome of the Outer.
From whence especially, but also round about, the _Bladders_ hereof
(all angular) are more and more amplified towards the _Centre_; most
of them being at least two hundred times biger, than those of the
Outer _Membrane_: ♦ _Tab. 80._ ♦ whereby it looks, through a _Glass_,
not unlike a _Coome_ full of _Hony_; or in regard of their great
transparency, like a company of little _Crystal Pans_ full of a pure
_Lympha_.

12. §. This Midle _Membrane_, is properly so called, from the state
and condition it hath, upon the _Augmentation_ of the _Seed_, at which
time, it obteins the nature of an _Involucrum_. But originally, it
is every where entire, without any _Hollow_, filling up the _Cavity_
of the Outer _Membrane_, like a soft and delicate _Pulp_. After a
short time, there appears in it a small _Ductus_ or _Chanel_; which
runs from the bottom to the top, like an _Axis_, through the midle of
it. ♦ _Tab. 81._ ♦ At first, no wider than to receive the _Hair_ of a
_Mans Head_; not visible, except in a slice hereof cut transversly,
and viewed in a _Glass_. Being grown a little wider, it may be seen,
if the _Membrane_ be dexterously cut by the length. At which time, it
is also dilated into two _Oval Cavities_, one at each end: which are
as two little _Cisterns_, whereinto a most pure _Lympha_ continually
owzeth, and is therein reserved for the nourishment of the _Seed_;
and through the _Chanel_ which runs between the _Cisterns_ is emptied
out of one _Cistern_ into another, according as the _Seed_ or the
Inmost _Membrane_ hath need of it; _i. e._ as the _Weather_ and other
Circumstances do more or less accelerate their _Growth_, and so render
the _Lympha_ useful to them.

13. §. A few days after this, the Innermost _Membrane_ begins to
appear; growing, like a soft _Node_ or _Bud_, out of the upper
_Cistern_; to the lower end of which it is joyned by a short and tender
_Stalk_, ♦ _Tab. 81._ ♦ from whence it is produced into a _Conick-oval
Figure_, answerable to that of the _Cistern_.

14. §. This _Membrane_, though soft and full of _Sap_, yet being
compared with the midlemost, is a close and compact _Body_, composed of
_Bladders_ above 300 times smaller than they are in that. Whereby, as
the _Seed_ is so well guarded, as not to be supplyed with any part of
the _Lympha_, but the purest: so neither with any more of this, than
will suffice, without the danger of making an _Inundation_ out of so
great a _Lake_.

15. §. This _Membrane_, if it be pulled with a most steady hand, and
very gently, upwards, it will draw a small transparent _String_ after
it to the bottom of the Midle _Membrane_: The said _String_ though
for the greater part, _Parenchymous_, yet being strengthened with the
_admixture_ of some _Lignous Fibres_; not otherwise visible in either
of these two _Membranes_. So that they seem, to be a small portion of
those which are inosculated at the bottome of the _Outer Membrane_,
and thence produced through the midlemost, underneath the _Chanel_,
till at last they break forth into the upper _Cistern_, where they form
this inner _Membrane_: a piece of close-wrought _Work_, suitable to the
incomparable fineness of all the _Stuff_ out of which it is made.

16. §. The same _Membrane_ is originally entire, as the Midlemost: but
being grown to about the bigness of a _Carvi-Seed_, becomes a little
hollow near the _Cone_. And the _Lignous Fibers_ abovesaid, ♦ _Tab.
81._ ♦ fetching their compass from the _Base_, shoot forth into the
_Cone_; and so make a very small _Node_ therein, for the first _Essay_
towards the _Generation_ of the _Seed_. The said _Fibers_ being thus
spun out, to the utmost degree of fineness for this purpose.

17. §. This _Node_, being grown about ⅕ᵗʰ part as big as a
_Cheese-Mite_; it begins next to be divided by a little indenture at
the _Top_. ♦ _Tab. 81._ ♦ Which growing by degrees still deeper, the
_Node_ is hereby at length distinguished into two _Lobes_ or thick
_Leavs_.

18. §. So soon as these are finished, their _Basis_ begins afterwards
to be contracted, ♦ _Tab. 81._ ♦ and so to be formed into a _Radicle_
or that part of the _Seed_ which becomes the _Root_. As the _Stalks_ of
_Fruits_ do grow lesser, while the _Fruits_ themselves are expanded. So
that in this estate, the _Radicle_ is, as it were, the _Stalk_ of the
_Seed_.

19. §. At this time, the _Seed_ being extream small, the _Lobes_ are
not so manageable as to be separated one from the other. But it is most
reasonable to suppose that so soon as the _Radicle_ is finished, the
next step, is the pushing forth of another _Node_, between the _Lobes_,
in order to the making of a _Bud_, and so the perfection of the _Seed_.

20. §. This being done or in doing, the _Radicle_ or _Stalk_ of the
_Seed_, containing still more and more at the bottome, hangs at the
Inner _Membrane_, only by an extream small and short _Ligament_ or
_Navel-String_. Which at last, also breaks; and so the _Seed_, as
_Fruits_ when they are ripe, falls off and lies loose in the Iner
_Membrane_; ♦ _Tab. 81._ ♦ this gradually shrinking up and so becoming
more hollow, to make room for the further _Growth_ of the _Seed_.

                                 WILLIAM

                       Lord VisCount _BROUNCKER_,

                                PRESIDENT

                                 OF THE

                             Royal Society.


MY LORD,

_ONE Reason why I Dedicate the following_ Discourses _to Your_
Lordship, _is, For that by Your great undeserved Respects, You have
obliged me to do no less._

_Another, my_ Lord, _is, Because I could not but Publickly return Your_
Lordship _Thanks, for minding the_ Royal Society _of so good a Way,
they are lately resolved upon, for the Management of a great part of
their Business. Wherein, my_ Lord, _I do more than presume, that I also
speak the Sense of the whole_ Society; _I think, not any one excepted._

_I may with the same Confidence intimate, my_ Lord, _how happy they
account themselves, in having a_ Person _so fit to preside their
Affairs, as Your_ Lordship. _The Largeness of your Knowledge, the
Exactness of Your Judgment, the Evenness of Your Comport; being some
of those necessary Qualifications, which His_ Majesty _had in His Eye
(as right well understanding what He did) when He fixed His Choice upon
Your_ Lordship.

_I know, my_ Lord, _that there are some men, who have just so
much Understanding, as only to teach them how to be Ambitious: The
Flattering of whom, is somewhat like the Tickling of Children, till
they fall a Dancing. But I also know, that Your_ Lordship _unconcerneth
Your self as much, in what I even now spake; as_ Cæsar _did himself,
when his_ Souldiers _began to style him_ King. _For as he said,_ Non
Rex, sed Cæsar: _So let Your_ Lordship _be but once nam’d, and all that
follows, is but a_ Tautology _to what You are already known to be. Your
being_ President _of the_ Royal Society, _Your being the_ First _that
was Chosen, and_ Chosen _by so Knowing a_ Prince; _becomes so real a_
Panegyrick _to Your_ Lordship, _as leaveth Verbal ones without any
sound._

_Whence, my_ Lord, _I have a third Reason most naturally emergent,
which is, That I dare to submit my self, as to what I have hereafter
said, to Your_ Lordships _Censure. You being so able and just an_
Arbiter _betwixt the same and all those Persons therein concern’d; that
You can neither be deceived, nor corrupted, to make a Judgment in any
Point, to the Injury of either._

_And truly, my_ Lord, _were it only from a Principle of self-Interest,
yet I could not desire it should be otherwise. For the_ World, _if it
lives, will certainly grow as much more knowing than it is; as it is
now more, than it was heretofore. So that we have as little Reason to
despise_ Antiquity; _as we can have willingness, that we our selves
should be despised by_ Posterity.

_Yet some difference there is to be made;_ viz. _betwixt those of all_
Ages, _who have been modestly ignorant; and those who have thought, or
pretended, that they were Omniscient. Or if knowing and acknowledging
that they were Ignorant; have yet not been contented to be so; unless,
with as good manners, as sense, they did conjure all Mankind not to
offer at the knowing any more than themselves._

_Upon the whole, my_ Lord, _I desire not You should be a_ Patron, _any
further than You are a_ Judge. _For if this small_ Essay _hath deserved
the least acceptance, I am sure, that in being one, You will be both._

                                 _I am_,

                                My Lord,
                     Your _Lordships_ most Faithful
                          and Obedient Servant,

                            _NEHEMJAH GREW_.




                                    A

                                DISCOURSE

                             Read before the

                                   OF

                                MIXTURE.


HAVING the honour to perform the Task of this day; I shall endeavour
to conform to the _Phylosophy_, which this _Society_ doth profess;
which is, _Reasoning grounded upon Experiment, and the Common Notions
of Sense_. The former being, without the latter, too subtle and
intangible; the latter without the former, too gross and unmanageable:
but both together, bearing a true analogy to our selves; who are
neither Angels, nor meer Animals, but Men.

The Subject I have chosen to speak of, is _Mixture_. Whereof,
that our _Discourse_ may be the more _consistent_, and the better
_intelligible_; all I have to say, shall be ranged into this Method;
_viz._

1. First, I shall give a brief account of the received _Doctrine_ of
_Mixture_.

2. Next, lay down some _Propositions_ of the _Principles_ whereof all
_Mixed_ Bodies consist.

3. Then, open the true _Nature_ of _Mixture_; or say, _What_ it is.

4. And then enumerate the _Causes_ of _Mixture_; or say, _How_ it is
made.

5. Lastly, I shall shew the _Power_ of _Mixture_; or, _What_ it can
_do_.




                                CHAP. I.

                 _Of the received Doctrine of_ Mixture.


FIRST, As to the received _Doctrine_ of _Mixture_; not to trouble you
with tedious quotations of what _Aristotle_, _Galen_, _Fernelius_,
_Scaliger_, _Sennertus_, _Riverius_, and other Learned men say
hereof; we may suppose the whole summed up in that _Definition_
which _Aristotle_ himself hath given of it, ♦ Lib. 1. _de Generat.
& Corrupt._ Cap. ult. ♦ and which the greater number of his
Followers, have almost religiously adhered to; _viz._ that ’tis,
τῶν μικτῶν ἀλλοιωθέντων ἕνωσις, that ’tis, _Miscibilium alteratorum
unio_. Which _Definition_, as it is usually explicated, is both
_Unintelligible_, and _Unuseful_.

2. §. Two things are _unintelligible_; what they mean by _Alteration_;
and what by _Union_. In this _Alteration_, they say, That the very
_Forms_ of the _Elements_ are _altered_. And therefore lay it down for
an _Axiom_, _Quod in Mixto, Formæ Elementares tantum sint in potentia_,
But let us see the consequence. For if in a _mixed_ body, the _Forms_
of the _Elements_ are but in _potentia_; then the _Elements_ themselves
are but _in potentia_: for we all say, _Forma dat esse_. And if the
_Compounding Elements_, are only _in potentia_; then the _Compounded
Body_ it self can be only _in potentia_; yet to say it is no more, is
most absurd.

3. §. As for the _Union_ of _Elements_ in a _mixed Body_; they make
it such, as brings them at last to assert, the _Penetration_ of
_Bodies_, and that the _Union_ of _mixed Bodies_ is nothing else. For
they say it is made in such sort, that every particle of the _mixed
Body_, partaketh of the _Nature_ of the whole. Which _Nature_, ariseth
from the contemperated _Qualities_ of the four _Elements_. Whence
they conclude, That every particle of the _mixed Body_, containeth
in it self all the four _Elements_. Which is plainly to assert a
_penetration_ of _Bodies_. For every _Element_ is, at least, one
particle; if therefore every particle of the _mixed_ Body, containeth
four _Elements_; then four particles are but one. I conclude then, That
the received _Doctrine_ of _Mixture_ is _Unintelligible_.

4. §. Whence it follows, That it is also _Barren_ and _Unuseful_.
For who can make any use of that which he understandeth not? And the
experience of so many years, wherein it hath been ventilated by the
disputes of men, proveth as much: Scarce any of them, except the
Learned _Sennertus_, daring to venture upon Experiment, for fear they
should come to understand themselves.

5. §. It is confessed, that many gallant things have been found out
by artificial _Mixture_. But no thanks to this _Definition_ of it.
For as an _Ignorant_ Man may make bad _Work_, and a good _Rule_ be
never the worse; so one that is _Ingenious_ may make good _Work_, and
a bad _Rule_ be never the better. The question is not, what have men
done? but what have they done upon this foundation, _Quod Mixitio sit
miscibilium alteratorum unio_. Had this ever taught them to do any
thing, even so much as to make the _Inke_ wherewith they have wrote,
all their _Disputes_; I confess, they would have had something to
shew for it. But the truth is, their _notions_ of _Mixture_, have
been so far from doing us any good, that they have done us much harm:
being, through their seeming subtlety, but real absurdity, as so many
phantastick _Spectrums_, serving only to affright men from coming near
them, or the Subject whereof they treat.

6. §. I shall therefore endeavour to open the true _Nature_ of
_Mixture_. And I shall build my _Doctrine_ upon the _Common Notions_
of _Sense_: which none can _deny_; and every one may _conceive_ of. In
order to which, I shall take leave to lay down some _Propositions_, of
the _Principles_ of all _mixed Bodies_.




                                CHAP. II.

                     _Of the Principles of Bodies._


AND first, by _Principles_, I mean _Atomes_, or certain _Sorts_ of
_Atomes_, or of the _simplest_ of _Bodies_. For otherwise they would
not be _Principles_; for a _compounded Principle_, in strict speaking,
is a _Contradiction_. Even as _Fives_, _Threes_, or _Two’s_ are not the
_Principles_ of _Number_, but _Unites_.

2. §. Whence, secondly, it follows, that they are also _Indivisible_.
Not _Mathematically_; for the _Atomes_ of every _Principle_ have their
_Dimensions_. But _Physically_; and so, what is but _one_, cannot
be made _two_. If it be asked, Whether a Stick cut with a Knife, be
not of one, made two? I say, that a Stick, is not _one_ Body, but
_many millions_ of Bodies; that is, of _Atomes_; not any one whereof
is _divided_ within it self, but only they are _separated_ one from
another, where the Knife forceth its way. As in the drawing of a mans
Finger through a Heap of Corn; there is no _Division_ made in any
one _Grain_, but only a _separation_ of them one from another, all
remaining still in themselves entire. I say, therefore, that what
is _Physically one_, is also most firm, and _Indivisible_, that is,
_Impenetrable_: for _Penetration_ is but the _Separation_, not the
_Division_ of _Atomes_.

3. §. Hence, thirdly, they are also _Immutable_. For that which
cannot be _divided_, cannot be _chang’d_. So that of the whole World
of _Atomes_, not any one hath ever suffer’d, or can suffer the least
_mutation_. Hereupon is grounded the _Constancy_ of _Causes_ and
_Effects_. So that, in all _Generations_, it is not less certain,
that the self same _Principle_ is still _propagated_ from the same;
than, that _Man_ is from _Man_. Wherefore, _compounded Bodies_ are
_generated_; but _Principles_ are not, but only _propagated_; that is,
in every _Generation_, they pass, in themselves unaltered, from one
Body, into another.

4. §. If _Principles_, or _Atomes_ are all _Immutable_; it again
follows, That they are of _Divers Kinds_. For one and the same
_Principle_, or _Kind_ of _Atomes_, will still make the _Same_ Thing,
and have the _same Effect_: so that all _Generations_ would then be the
_Same_. Wherefore, since they are _Immutable_, they must be _Divers_.

5. §. This _Diversity_, for the same reason, is not small, but very
_Numerous_. For as the _World_, taken together, is _Natures Shop_;
so the _Principles_ of Things are her _Tools_, and her _Materials_.
Wherefore, as it speaks the _goodness_ of a _Shop_; so the _Perfection_
of the _Universe_, That it is furnished with many _Tools_ wherewith,
and many _Materials_ whereupon to _work_. And consequently, that
_Philosophy_ beareth best its own name; which doth not strain all to
two or three _Principles_, like two or three Bells in a Steeple,
making a pitiful _Chime_: but tryeth to rise up to _Natures_ own
_Number_, and so to _ring_ all the _Changes_ in the World.

6. §. Yet doth not this vast _Diversity_ take away the _Regiment_ and
_Subordination_ of _Principles_. There being a certain lesser _number_
of them, which either by their greater _quantity_, or other ways,
have _Rule_ and _Dominion_, in their several _Orders_, over all the
rest. For where-ever the _Subject_ is _Multitude_, _Order_ is part of
its _Perfection_. For _Order_ is _Proportion_. And how can _Nature_
be imagin’d to hold _Proportion_ in all things else, and not here?
Wherefore, as certainly, as _Order_ and _Government_ are in all the
Parts of the _Rational_; so certainly, of the _Material World_. Whence
it is, That although the _Species_ of _Principles_ be very _numerous_;
yet the _Principles_ called _Galenical_, _Chymical_, or any others,
which do any way fall under the notice of Sense, are notwithstanding
_reduceable_ to a _smaller number_: _viz._ according to the _number_
of _Predominant Principles_ in _Nature_; or, rather in this part of
the _Universe_ which is _near and round about us_. To the _Power_ and
_Empire_ whereof, all other _Principles_ do submit. Which _Submission_,
is not the _quitting_ of their own _Nature_; but only their appearance
under the external Face or _Habit_ of the said _Predominant Principles_.

7. §. As there can be no _Order_ of _Principles_, without _Diversity_;
so no _Diversity_, but what is _originally_ made by these two ways;
_sc._ by _Size_ and _Figure_. By _these_ they may be exceeding
different: and all other _Properties_ besides, whereby they differ,
must be _dependent_ upon _these Two_.

8. §. Nor therefore, can they be of any other _Figures_, than what are
_Regular_. For _Regularity, is a Similitude continu’d_. Since therefore
all kinds of _Atomes_ are _divers_ only by their _Size_ and _Figure_;
if the selfe same _Size_ and _Figure_ were not _common_ to a certain
number of _Atomes_, they could not be said to be of any _one kind_: and
consequently, if there were no _Similitude_ of _Atomes_, there could be
no _Distinction_ of _Principles_.

9. §. Hence also, these two _Modes_ of _Atomes_, _viz._ their _Size_
and _Figure_, are the true, and only _original Qualities_ of _Atomes_.
That is, an _Atome_ is _such_ or _such_, because it is of such a
certain _Size_ and _Figure_.

10. §. Lastly, As these two _Modes_, taken severally, are the
_Qualities_ of an _Atome_: so consider’d together, they are its _Form_.
A _Substantial Form_ of a _Body_, being an unintelligible thing. I
say of a _Body_; for although the _Rational Soul_ be a _Substantial
Form_, yet is it the _Form_ of a _Man_, and not of a _Body_. For the
_Form_ of a _Body_, we can conceive of no otherwise, than as of the
_Modification_ of a _Body_, or a _Complexion_ of all the _Modes_ of a
_Body_. Which also agrees with that _Definition_ of a _Form_, which
amongst the _Peripatetick Philosophers_ is well enough accepted,
_viz._ _Quod sit, Ratio ejus Essentiæ, quæ cuique Rei competit_.
Which _Ratio_, if it be referred to a _Body_, what is it, but the
_Modification_ of that _Body_? Having thus proposed a Summary of my
_Thoughts_ about _Principles_; I shall next proceed to shew what their
_Mixture_ is.




                               CHAP. III.

                       _Of the NATURE of_ Mixture.


AND first of all, from the _Premisses_, we arrive at this _Conclusion_;
_sc._ That the _Formation_ and _Transformation_ of all Bodies, can be
nothing else, but the _Mixture_ of Bodies. For all _Principles_ are
_immutable_; ♦ _Ch. 2. §. 3._ ♦ as we have above proved: and therefore
not _generable_, _formable_, or _transformable_. And the _Forms_ of
_Principles_, being but their _Modes_, are also _immutable_. ♦ _Ch.
2. §. 10._ ♦ So that the whole _Business_ of the _Material World_, is
nothing else, but _Mixture_.

2. §. Again, as _Nature_ worketh every where only by _Mixture_; so
is this _Mixture_ every where but _one thing_, and can be but _one_.
For whether it be the _Mixture_ of _great_ Bodies, or of _small_; of
_Compounds_, or of _Atomes_; it is every where _Mixture_, and the
_Mixture_ of _Bodies_. ♦ _Ch. 2. §. 2._ ♦ Wherefore, _Mixture_ is
either an _intelligible Affection_ of _all_ Bodies, or of _none_; which
later, no man will say. As many ways therefore, as we can _see_, or
_conceive_ the _Mixture_ of any _gross_ Bodies, which we hold in our
hand; so many ways, we may, of the _subtilest Mixtures_ which _Nature_
maketh, or of _Atomes_ themselves; and no other ways.

3. §. Now all the ways we can distinguish _Mixture_ by, are, in
general, these _Two_; either in respect of the _Bodies Mixed_, or else
of the _Modes_ of the _Mixture_ it self.

4. §. In respect of the _Bodies Mixed_, _Mixture_ is distinguished also
_two_ ways; _viz._ by _Conjugation_, and by _Proportion_.

5. §. By _Conjugation_, I mean, a _Mixture of some certain Principles,
and not of others_. Which is _threefold_. _First_, As to _Number_:
as when one Body may be compounded of _two Principles_, another of
_three_, a third of _four_, a fourth of _five_, and so on. _Secondly_,
As to _Kind_: where, though there be a conjunction of the same
_Number_, yet not of the same _Kind_. _Thirdly_, When they differ from
one another both in _Number_ and _Kind_. So many ways the _Principles_
of Bodies may be conceived to be _Conjugated_; and therefore are: for
here, that which _may_ be, _is_. The Consequence is clear. For _first_,
_Nature_ hath various _Materials_ wherewith to make these _Mixtures_;
as we have shewed. ♦ _Ch. 2. §. 5._ ♦ _Secondly_, By these _Mixtures_
she _may_, and without the concurrence of any imaginary _Forms_, _must_
produce all the varieties in the _material World_; as likewise hath
been said. ♦ _Ch. 3. §. 1._ ♦ Wherefore, since all imaginable _Mixtures
may_ be _made_, and that to _some purpose_; if they should not be _so_,
_Nature_ would be _Imperfect_: because we our selves can think, how she
might put her _Materials_ to further use, then _so_ she would do. To
think therefore, that all _Kinds_ of _Principles_, or all _Elements_ go
to make up every _Compounded Body_, as by the _Peripatetick Philosophy_
we are taught; is a conceit, no more to be credited, than one that
should tell us, all _Kind_ of _Wheels_ and other _parts_ of a _Watch_,
were put into a _Clock_; or that there were no other _Materials_
wherewith to build an _House_, then for a _Tent_ or a _Ship_. For why
should _Nature_, the great _Artificer_ by which all _perfect Works_ are
made, be feigned to cram and ram _all things into one_, which we our
selves look upon as absurd?

6. §. _Secondly_, The _Mixture_ of _Principles_ is diversifi’d, as
by _Conjugation_, so also by _Proportion_. That is, by the divers
_Quantities_, of the several _Principles_ or _Parts mixed_ together.
As if the _Quantity_ of one, were as _five_ to _ten_; of a second, as
_five_ to _fifteen_; of a third, as _five_ to _twenty_, &c. Or if that
of one, be as _five_ to _six_; of a second, as _six_ to _seven_; of a
third, as _seven_ to _eight_. By which, and by other _Proportions_,
_Mixture_ may be varied innumerable ways.

7. §. _Again_, As _Mixture_ is varied with respect to the _Bodies
Mixed_; so likewise in respect of the _Mixture_ it self, which I call
the _Location_ of _Principles_, or the _Modes_ of their _Conjunction_.
Which may be various, as well as their _Conjugation_ and _Proportion_.
Yet are they all reduceable unto _two_ general _Modes_: ♦ _Ch. 2. §.
2._ ♦ all _Bodies_, and therefore all _Principles_, being _mixed_
either by _Mediation_, or by _Contact_.

8. §. Now all _Contact_, whether of _Compounds_, or of _Atomes_, can be
no other way, than such as is answerable to their _Figures_. Whereof,
therefore, we can conceive but _three_ general ways, _viz._

_First_, By _Contact_ in a _Point_, or some _smaller part_: as when
_two Atomes_ meet, which are _globular_ or otherwise _gibbose_.
_Secondly_, By _Contact_ in a _Plain_: as in the conjunction of the
_sides_ of _Triangular_ or _Quadrangular Atomes_, or otherwise _flat_.
_Thirdly_, By _Contact_ in a _Concave_: as when one _Atome_ is admitted
into the _Concave_ or _hole_ of another; as a Spigot is into a Fosset.
The _first_ may be called, _Apposition_; the _second_, _Application_;
the _third_, _Reception_ or _Intrusion_.

9. §. In the _two last_ ways, _Atomes_ may be joyned by _Mediation_;
but best of all the _last_. As when the _two extreams_ of one _Atome_
are received into the _Concaves_ or the _holes_ of two others.

10. §. And these are all the _general_ ways, whereby we can conceive
Bodies to be _Mixed_ together; _sc._ by their various _Conjugation_,
_Proportion_ and _Location_. So that the _Composition_ of _Atomes_, in
_Bodies_; is like that of _Letters_, in _Words_. What a Thunderclap
would such a _Word_ be, wherein all the four and twenty _Letters_ were
pack’d up? One therefore is compounded of more, another of fewer: this
of some, and that of others: and both the _Conjugation_, _Proportion_,
and _Location_ of _Letters_ is varied in every _Word_: whereby, we
have many thousands of _differing Words_, without any _alteration_ at
all, in the _Letters themselves_; and might have ten times as many
more. In like manner, therefore, or in the self same analogous way, as
the _Letters_ of the _Alphabet_, are the _Principles_ of _Words_; so
_Principles_, are the _Alphabet_ of _Things_.

11. §. What we have said of _Principles_; and of _Mixture_ as
consequent thereupon; may be a _foundation_ for an _intelligible_
account, of the _Nature_ and _Cause_ of most of the Intrinsick
_Properties_, and _Qualities_ of _Bodies_: as of _Gravity_, _Levity_,
_Fixity_, _Fluidity_, _Angularity_, _Roundness_, _Heat_, _Cold_,
_Blackness_, _Whiteness_, _Sowerness_, _Sweetness_, _Fragrancy_,
_Fetidness_, and very many more. I say an _intelligible_ account;
_sc._ such as is grounded upon the _Notions_ of _Sense_, and made out
_Mechanically_. But the exemplification hereof, being too large a
field for this, or any one _Lecture_, I shall, before I come to the
_Causes_ of _Mixture_, only deduce from the _Premises_, these following
_Corollaries_.

12. §. _First_, That there is no _alteration_ of _Principles_ or of
_Elements_, in the most _perfect Mixture_ of Bodies. It _cannot_ be;
for _Principles_ are _Immutable_, as we have said. ♦ _Ch. 2. §. 3._
♦ And if it could be, yet it _needeth not_ to be: for they are also
_many_, and _compoundable infinite_ ways; ♦ _Ch. 2. §. 5._ ♦ as hath
been shewed. So that we have no need to perplex our selves with any of
those difficulties, ♦ _Ch. 3. §. 10._ ♦ that arise from the _Doctrine_
of the _Alteration_ of _Elements_. The ground of which conceit, is
that, of there being but four _Elements_, and all in every particle of
the _mixed Body_. And so men being puzeled, how from thence to make out
the infinite _variety_ of Bodies, they feigned them to be alterable,
and _altered_, upon every _perfect Mixture_. Not considering, that if
their four _Elements_ be _alterable_; as few as they are, no fewer then
_three_ of them may be spared: for _one Element_, if _alterable_, may
be made _any_.

13. §. Hence, _Secondly_, may be solved that great _Dispute_, Whether
such as we call _Lixivial Salts_, are _made_ by the _fire_? For
_first_, No _Principle_ is made by the _fire_: ♦ _Ch. 2. §. 3._ ♦
all _Principles_ being _unalterable_; and therefore _unmakable_.
_Secondly_, We must therefore distinguish betwixt the _Principle_,
and its various _Mixture_ with other _Principles_; from whence it may
receive different _Shapes_ and _Names_. Wherefore, a _Lixivial Salt_,
_qua Lixivial_, is certainly _made_ by the _fire_. But _quatenus
Salt_, it is not: that _Principle_ being _extractable_ out of _most_
Bodies; and by _divers_ other _ways_, then by the _fire_. For whether
you _Calcine_ a body, or else _Ferment_ it, (after the manner shewed
by the _curious Improver_ of _Chymical_ Knowledge, _Dr. Daniel Cox_)
or _putrifie_ it under ground, or _drown_ it in the Sea; it still
yieldeth _some kind_ of _Salt_. All which _Salts_ are _made_, not by
_making_ the _Saline Principle_; but only by its being differently
_Mixed_, by those several ways of the _Solution_ of Bodies, with
other _Principles_: from which its different _Mixture_, it receives
the _various Denominations_, of _Marine_, _Nitrous_, _Volatile_, or
_Lixivial_.

14. §. Hence, _Thirdly_, the most _perfect Mixture_ of Bodies, can go
no higher than _Contact_. For all _Principles_ are _unalterable_; ♦
_Ch. 2. §. 3._ ♦ and all _Matter_ is _impenetrable_; as hath been said.
♦ _Ch. 3. §. 2._ ♦ In the most _visible_ and _laxe Mixture_, there is
_Contact_; and in the most _subtile_ and _perfect_, as in _Generation_
it self, there is _nothing more_.

15. §. Hence, _Fourthly_, we easily understand, how divers of the same
_Principles_, belonging both to _Vegetables_ and many _other_ Bodies,
are also _actually_ existent in the Body of _Man_. Because even in
_Generation_ or _Transmutation_, the _Principles_ which are translated
from one Body to another, as from a _Vegetable_ to an _Animal_, are not
in the least _alter’d_ in themselves; but only their _Mixture_, that
is, their _Conjugation_, _Proportion_ and _Location_, is _varied_.

16. §. Hence also the difference of _Mixture_, arising from the
difference of _Contact_, is intelligible; _sc._ as to those _three
degrees_, _Congregation_, _Union_, and _Concentration_.

_Congregation_, and _Inconsistent Mixture_, is when the several
_Atomes_ touch but in a _Point_, or _smaller part_. ♦ _Ch. 3. §. 8._
♦ In _which_ manner, I have divers arguments, inducing me to believe
the _Atomes_ of all _Fluid Bodies_, _qua Fluid_, do touch; and in _no
other_.

♦ _Ch. 3. §. 8._ ♦ _Union_, is when they touch in a _Plain_. As in the
_Crystals_ and _Shootings_ of all _Salts_, and _other_ like Bodies.
For if we pursue their divided and subdivided parts, with our eye, as
far as we can; they still _terminate_, on every side, in _Plains_.
Wherefore, ’tis intelligible, That their very _Atomes_ do also
_terminate_, and therefore _touch_, in _Plain_.

_Concentration_, is when two, or more _Atomes_ touch by _Reception_
and _Intrusion_ of one into another: ♦ _Ch. 3. §. 8._ ♦ which is the
_closest_, and _firmest Mixture_ of all; as in any _fixed unodorable_,
or _untastable_ Body: the _Atomes_ of such Bodies, being not able to
make any _Smell_ or _Taste_, unless they were first _dissolved_; that
is to say, _unpin’d_ one from another.

17. §. Hence, _Sixthly_, we understand, how in some cases, there
seemeth to be a _Penetration_ of _Bodies_; and in what _sense_ it may
be admitted: _viz._ if we will mean no more by _Penetration_, but
_Intrusion_. For the _Intrusion_ of one _Atome_ into the _Concave_ or
_hole_ of another, is a _kind_ of _Penetration_; whereby they take up
less room in the _mixed_ Body, then they would do by any other way of
_Contact_. As a naked knife and its sheath, take up almost double room,
to what they do, when the knife is sheathed. Whence we may assign the
_reason_, Why many _Liquors_ being _mixed_; take up less room or space,
then they did _apart_; as the _Ingenious_ Mr. _Hook_ hath made it to
appear by _Experiment_, that they do. I say the plain _reason_ hereof,
or at least one reason, is the _Intrusion_ of many of their _Atomes_
into one another. Which yet is not a _Penetration_ of Bodies strictly
so called.

18. §. _Seventhly_, If all that _Nature maketh_, be but _Mixture_; ♦
_Ch. 3. §. 1._ ♦ and all this _Mixture_ be but _Contact_ ’tis then
evident, That _Natural_ and _Artificial_ Mixture, are the _same_.
♦ _Ch. 3. §. 14._ ♦ And all those _seeming subtilties_ whereby
_Philosophers_ have gone about to _distinguish_ them; have been but so
many _Scarcrows_ to affright _Men_ from the _Imitation_ of _Nature_.

19. §. _Eighthly_, Hence it follows, That _Art_ it self may go far
in doing what _Nature_ doth. And who can say, how far? For we have
nothing to _Make_; but only to _mix_ those _Materials_, which are
already _made_ to our hands. Even _Nature_ her self, as hath been
said, _Maketh_ nothing _new_; ♦ _Ch. 3. §. 1._ ♦ but only _mixeth_ all
things. So far, therefore, as we can govern _Mixture_, we may do what
_Nature_ doth.

20. §. Which that we may still the better understand; let us before,
and in the next place, see the _Causes_ of _Mixture_. ♦ _Ch. 3. §. 18._
♦ For since _Natural_ and _Artificial Mixture_ are the _same_; the
_immediate Causes_ of both, are and must be the _same_.




                                CHAP. IV.

                       _Of the CAUSES of Mixture._


NOW all the _Causes_ of _Mixture_ we can conceive of, must, I think,
be reduced to these _six_ in _general_; _viz._ _Congruity_, _Weight_,
_Compression_, _Solution_, _Digestion_, and _Agitation_.

1. §. _Congruity_, or aptitude and _respondence_ betwixt the _Sizes_
and _Figures_ of _Parts_ to be _mixed_: whereby Bodies may be truly
called the _Instrumental Causes_ of their own _Mixture_. As when a
_Plain_ answers to a _Plain_, a _Square_ to a _Square_, a _Convex_ to a
_Concave_, or a _Less_ to a _Greater_ or an _Equal_, &c. according to
which _Respondencies_ in the _parts_ of Bodies, they are more or less
easily _mingleable_.

2. §. _Weight_, by means whereof all _Fluid_ Bodies, upon supposition
of the _Congruity_ of their parts, must unavoidably _mingle_.

3. §. _Compression_; which either by the _Air_, or any other Body,
added to _Weight_, must, in some degree, further _Mixture_. Because,
that _Weight_ it self, is but _Pression_. For further Proof of all the
said _Causes_, I made this _Experiment_; Let _Oyl_ of _Aniseeds_, and
_Oyl_ of _Vitriol_ be put apart into the _Receiver_ of an _Air-Pump_.
And, having _exhausted_ it of the _Air_, let the _two_ said _Oyls_ be
then affused one upon the other. Whereupon, _First_, It is visible,
that they here _mix_ and _coagulate_ together; that is, their parts
are _wedged_ and _intruded_ one into another, without the _usual
compression_ of the _Air_; for that is _exhausted_, and therefore only
by the _Congruity_ of their receiving and intruding parts; and by their
_Weight_; by _which_ alone they are so _compressed_, as to make that
_Intrusion_. _Secondly_, It is also evident, That although they do
_Coagulate_; yet not altogether so much, as when poured together in the
same manner, and quantity, in the _open Air_. Wherefore, _Compression_,
whether made by the _Air_, or any thing else, as it doth further the
_Dissolution_ of some Bodies, so the _Mixture_ of others, and the
greater the _Compression_, the more.

4. §. _Solution_; For all Bodies _mix_ best, in _Forma fluida_. And
that for two reasons. _First_, Because the _parts_ of a Body are not
then in a _state_ of _Union_, but of _Separation_; and therefore, in a
more capable _state_, for their _Mixture_ and _Union_ with the _parts_
of _another_ Body. _Secondly_, because then they are also in a _state_
of _Motion_, more or less; and therefore, in a continual tendency
towards _Mixture_; all _Mixture_ being made by _Motion_. Wherefore
all _Generations_, and most _perfect Mixtures_ in _Nature_, are made
by _Fluids_; whether _Animal_, _Vegetable_, or _Mineral_. Which is
also agreeable to the _Doctrine_ of the _Honourable_ Mr. _Boyle_, in
his _Excellent Treatise_ of the _Nature_ and _Vertues_ of _Gems_. And
it is well known, That Bodies are ordinarily _petrified_, or _Stones
made_, out of _Water_. That is, out of _petrifying parts_ dissolved
_per minima_ in _Water_, as both their _Menstruum_ and their _Vehicle_.
Wherefore, if we will talk of _making Gold_; it must not be by the
Philosophers _Stone_, but by the Philosophers _Liquor_.

5. §. _Digestion._ For which there is the same reason, as for
_Mixture_, by _Solution_. For, _First_, All heat doth _attenuate_,
that is, still further _separate_ the _parts_ of a Body; and so render
them more _mingleable_ with the _parts_ of _another_. And therefore,
_Secondly_, Doth also add more _Motion_ to them, in order to their
_Mixture_.

6. §. _Agitation._ Which I am induced to believe a great and effectual
means of _Mixture_, upon divers Considerations. As, _First_, That the
_making_ of _Blood_ in the _Bodies_ of _Animals_, and the _mixing_ of
the _Chyle_ therewith, is very much promoted by the same means; _sc._
by the _Agitation_ of the parts of the _Blood_ and _Chyle_, in their
continual _Circulation_. _Again_, from the _making_ of _Butter_ out
of _Milk_, by the same means: whereby alone is made a _separation_
of the oleous parts from the _Whey_, and Conjunction of the _Oleous_
together. _Moreover_, From the great _Effects_ of _Digestion_; well
known to all that are conversant in _Chymical Preparations_. Which
_Digestion_ it self, is but a _kind_ of _insensible agitation_ of the
_parts_ of _digested_ Bodies. ’Tis _also_ a known _Experiment_, That
the readiest way to dissolve _Sugar_ in _Wine_ or other _Liquor_; is
to give the _Vessel_ a _hasty turn_, together with a _smart knock_,
against any _hard_ and _steady_ Body: whereby all the parts of the
_Sugar_ and _Liquor_, are put into a vehement _Agitation_, and so the
_Sugar_ immediately dissolved, and _mixed_ with the _Liquor_. And I
remember, that having (with intent, to make Mr. _Matthews’s Pill_)
put some _Oyl_ of _Turpentine_ and _Salt_ of _Tartar_ together in a
Bottle, and sent it up hither out of the _Country_; I found, that the
continual _Agitation_ upon the _Road_, for three or four days, had done
more towards their _Mixture_; than a far greater time of _Digestion_
alone had done before. And it is certain, That a vehement _Agitation_,
especially, if continu’d, or joyned with _Digestion_; will accelerate
the _Mixture_ of some Bodies, ten times more, than any bare _Digestion_
alone; as may be proved by many _Experiments_. I will instance in this
one. Let some _Oyl_ of _Turpentine_ and good _Spirit_ of _Nitre_ be
stop’d up together in a Bottle, and the Bottle held to the Fire, till
the _Liquors_ be a little heated, and begin to bubble. Then having
removed it, and the Bubbles by degrees increasing more and more; the
two _Liquors_ will of themselves, at last fall into so impetuous an
_Ebullition_, as to make a kind of _Explosion_; sending forth a _smoak_
for the space of almost _two yards_ high. Whereupon, the _parts_ of
both the _Liquors_, being violently _agitated_, they are, in a _great
portion_, _incorporated_ into a _thick Balsam_ in a _moment_: and that
without any _intense_ heat, as may be felt by the Bottle. And thus much
for the _Causes_ of _Mixture_.




                                CHAP. V.

                   _Of the POWER and USE of Mixture._


HAVING enumerated the _general Causes_, we shall, lastly, enquire
into the _Power_ and _Use_ of _Mixture_; or, into what it can _Do_
and _Teach_. And I shall Instance in _six_ particulars. _First_, to
Render all Bodies _Sociable_, whatsoever they be. _Secondly_, To _Make
Artificial_ Bodies in Imitation of those of _Natures_ own production.
_Thirdly_, to _make_ or _imitate_ the _sensible Qualities_ of Bodies;
as _Smells_, and _Tasts_. _Fourthly_, To _make_, or _imitate_ their
_Faculties_. _Fifthly_, It is a _Key_, to discover the _Nature_ of
_Bodies_. _Sixthly_, To discover their _Use_, and the _Manner_ of their
_Medicinal Operation_.


                               INSTANCE I.

_FIRST_, To render all Bodies _Sociable_ or _Mingleable_: as _Water_
with _Oyl_, _Salt_ with _Spirit_, and the like. For _Natural_ and
_Artificial Mixture_, are the same; as we have before proved. ♦
_Ch. 3. §. 18._ ♦ If therefore _Nature_ can do it, as we see in the
_Generation_ of Bodies she doth, ’tis likewise in the _Power_ of _Art_
to do it.

2. §. And for the doing of it, two _general Rules_ result from the
_Premisses_, _sc._ The _Application_ of _Causes_, and the _Choice_ of
_Materials_. As for the _Causes_, they are such as I have now instanc’d
in. ♦ _Ch. 4._ ♦ And for the _Application_ of them, I shall give these
_two Rules_.

3. §. _First_, That we tread in _Natures_ steps as near as we can; not
only in the _Application_ of such a _Cause_, as may be most proper
for such a _Mixture_; but also in allowing it _sufficient time_ for
its _effect_. For so we see _Nature_ her self, for her more _perfect
Mixtures_, usually doth. She maketh not a _Flower_, or an _Apple_, a
_Horse_, or a _Man_, in a _moment_; but all things by _degrees_; and
for her more _perfect and elaborate Mixtures_, for the most part,
she requireth _more time_. Because all such _Mixtures_ are made and
carri’d on _per minima_; and therefore require a greater time for the
compleating of them.

4. §. A _second Rule_ is, Not only to make a due _Application_ of the
_Causes_; but sometimes to _Accumulate_ them. By which means, we may
not only, _imitate Nature_, but in some cases go beyond her. For as
by adding a _Graft_ or _Bud_ to the _Stock_, we may produce _Fruit_
_sooner_, and sometimes _better_, than _Nature_ by the _Stock_ alone
would do: So here, by _accumulating_ the _Causes_ of _Mixture_, that
is, by joyning _two_, _three_, or _more_ together; or by _applying
more_ in some Cases, where _Nature_ applyeth _fewer_; we may be able
to make, if not a more _perfect_, yet a far more _speedy Mixture_,
than _Nature_ doth. As by joyning _Compression_, _Heat_, and violent
_Agitation_, and so continuing them all together, by some means
contrived for the purpose, for the space of a _Week_, or _Month_,
or _longer_, without cessation. Which may probably produce, not only
_strange_, but _useful Effects_, in the _Solution_ of some, and the
_Mixture_ of other Bodies. And may serve to _mix_ such Bodies, as
through the _small number_ of their _congruous_ parts, are hardly
_mingleable_ any other way. _Agitation_ being, as carrying the _Key_ to
and fro, till it hit the _Lock_; or within the _Lock_, till it hit the
_Wards_.

5. §. _Secondly_, For the _Choice_ of _materials_, if they are not
_immediately_, that is, of themselves, _mingleable_; we are then to
turn one _Species_ of _Mixture_ into a _Rule_; ♦ _Ch. 3. §. 9._ ♦ which
is, To _mix_ them by _mediation_ of some _third_, whether more _simple_
or _compounded_ Body, which may be congruous _in part_ to them _both_:
as _Sulphurous Salts_ are to _Water_ and _Oyl_; and are for that reason
_mingleable_ with _either_ of them. Or, By any _two_ congruous Bodies,
which are also, _in part_, congruous to _two others_: and other like
ways. Whereby the _parts_ of Bodies, though never so _heterogeneous_,
may yet be all _bound_ and _lock’d_ up together. Even as _twenty Keys_
may be _united_, only by _uniting_ the _two Rings_ whereon they hang.

6. §. The Consideration of these things, have put me upon making
several _Experiments_, for the _mingling_ of _heterogeneous_ Bodies. I
shall give two Examples of Tryal; the one upon _Fluid_, the other upon
_consistent_ Bodies.

7. §. For the _first_, I took _Oyl_ of _Aniseeds_, and pouring it
upon another Body; I so order’d it, that it was thereby turned into a
perfect _milk-white Balsam_, or _Butyr_. By which means the said _Oyl_
became _mingleable_ with any _Winy_, or _Watery Liquor_; _easily_,
and _instantaneously dissolving_ therein, in the form of a _Milk_.
And _note_, That this is done, without the _least alteration_ of
the _Smell_, _Tast_, _Nature_, or _Operation_ of the said _Oyl_. By
somewhat the like means, not only _Oyl_ of _Aniseeds_, but any other
_stillatitious Oyl_, may be transformed into a _milk-white Butyr_; and
in like manner be _mingled_ with _Water_ or any other _Liquor_. Which
is of _various use_ in _Medicine_; and what I find oftentimes very
convenient and advantageous to be done.

8. §. Again, not only _Fluid_ but _consistent_ Bodies, which of
themselves will _mix_ only with _Oyl_; by due _mixture_ with other
Bodies, may be render’d _easily_ dissoluble in _Water_; as may _Rosin_,
and all _resinous_ and _friable Gums_. As also _Wax_: and this without
changing much of their _Color_, _Tast_, or _Smell_. Whereof likewise,
whatsoever others may do, the _Physician_ may make a manifold _Use_.


                              INSTANCE II.

BY _Mixture_ also, we may be _taught_ to _Imitate_ the _Productions_ of
_Nature_. As to which, from what we have before said of _Mixture_, we
may conclude; That there is no _Generation_ of Bodies _unorganical_,
but what is in the _Power_ of _Mixture_ to _imitate_. As of _Animals_,
to Imitate _Blood_, _Fat_, _Chyle_, _Spittle_, _Flegm_, _Bile_, &c.
Of _Vegetables_, to Imitate a _Milk_, _Mucilage_, _Rosin_, _Gum_,
or _Salt_. Of _Minerals_, to Imitate _Vitriol_, _Allom_, and other
_Salts_; as also _Metals_, and the like.

2. §. I do not say, I can do all this: yet if, upon good _Premisses_,
we can conclude this possible to be done; it is one step to the doing
of it. But I will also give an _Instance_ of somewhat that may be
_done_ in _every kind_. And,

3. §. _First_, For the _Imitation_ of an _Animal Body_, I will instance
in _Fat_. Which may be _made_ thus; Take _Oyl Olive_, and pour it
upon high _Spirit_ of _Nitre_. Then _digest_ them for some days. By
degrees, the _Oyl_ becomes of the _colour_ of _Marrow_; and at last,
is _congealed_, or hardened into a _white Fat_ or _Butter_, which
_dissolveth_ only by the _fire_, as that of _Animals_. In converting
_Oyl_ thus into _Fat_, it is to be _noted_, That it _hardens_ most
upon the _exhalation_ of some of the more _Sulphureous_ parts of the
_Spirit_ of _Nitre_. Which I effected, well enough for my purpose, by
unstopping the glass after some time of _digestion_; and so suffering
the _Oyl_ to _dissolve_ and _thicken_ divers times by successive _heat_
and _cold_. Hence, The true _Congealing Principle_, is a _Spirit of
Nitre separated from its Sulphur_. For the better doing whereof, the
_Aer_ is a most commodious _Menstruum_ to the said _Spirit_ of _Nitre_.
Whence also, if we could procure such a _Spirit_ of _Nitre_, we might
_congeal Water_ in the midst of _Summer_. We might also _refrigerate
Rooms_ herewith _Artificially_. And might _Imitate_ all _frosty
Meteors_. For the _making_ of _Fat_, is but the _Durable Congelation_
of _Oyl_: which may be done without _frost_, as I have shewed how.

Hence also it appears, That _Animal Fat_ it self, is but the _Curdling_
of the _Oyly_ parts of the _Blood_; either by some of its own _Saline_
parts; or by the _Nitrous_ parts of the _Aer_ mingled therewith.

Hence likewise it is, That some _Animals_, as _Conies_, and
_Fieldfares_, grow _fatter_ in _frosty_ weather: the _oily_ parts
of the _blood_, being then more than ordinarily _coagulated_ with a
greater abundance of _nitrous_ parts received from the _Aer_ into their
_bodies_.

For the same reason it is, That the _Fat_ of _Land-Animals_ is _hard_;
whereas that of _Fishes_ is _very soft_, and runs all to _Oyl_, _sc._
Because the _Water_, wherein they live, and which they have instead of
_breath_, hath but very few _nitrous_ parts in it, in comparison of
what the _Aer_ hath.

4. §. _Secondly_, For the _Imitation_ of a _Vegetable Body_, I will
give three _Instances_; In _Rosin_, _Gum_, and a _Lixivial Salt_. The
_first_ may be made thus; Take good _Oyl_ of _Vitriol_, and drop it
upon _Oyl_ of _Anise seeds_; and they will forthwith _incorporate_
together; and by degrees, will _harden_ into a _perfect Rosin_; with
the _general_ and _defining Properties_ of a _truly Natural Resinous
Gum_. Being not at all _dissoluble_ in _Water_; or at least, not
any more, then any natural _Rosin_ or _Gum_: yet very _easily_ by
_fire_: as also highly _inflamable_: and exceeding _friable_. Although
this _Artificial Rosin_, be the result of _two Liquors_, both which
very strongly affect the _Sense_: yet being well _washed_ from the
_unincorporated parts_, (which is to be done with some care) it hath
scarce any _Tast_ or _Smell_.

The _Concentration_ of these _two Liquors_, is likewise so _universal_;
that the _Rosin_ is not made by _Precipitation_, but almost a _total
Combination_ of the said _Liquors_; and that with scarce so much, as
any _visible_ fumes.

5. §. _Again_, Having taken a certain _Powder_ and a _Saline Liquor_,
and mixed them together in a bottle, and so _digested_ them for some
time; the _Powder_ was at last transmuted to a perfect _Oily Gum_;
which will also _dissolve_ either in _Oyl_ or in _Water_; in the self
same manner, as _Galbanum_, _Ammoniac_, and the like will do.

6. §. And _Lastly_, A _Lixivial Salt_ may be _imitated_ thus; Take
_Nitre_, _Oyl_ of _Vitriol_, and high _spirit_ of _Wine_, of each
a like quantity. Of these _three_ Bodies, not any _two_ being _put
together_, that is to say neither the _Nitre_ with the _Oyl_, nor the
_Oyl_ with the _Spirit_, nor the _Nitre_ with the _Spirit_, will make
the least _Ebullition_: yet all _three mingled together_, make a very
_conspicuous one_. The _Spirit_ of _Wine_ being as the _Sulphur_; and
so that, and the _Nitre_ together, standing, as it were, in the stead
of an _Alkalizate_, that is, a _Sulphurious Salt_, against the _Oyl_ of
_Vitriol_. Divers other _Experiments_ may be shew’n of the like Nature.

7. §. In the last place, for the _Imitation_ of a _Mineral Body_, I
will instance in _two_, _sc._ _Nitre_ and _Marine Salt_; if I may have
leave to reckon them amongst _Mineral Bodies_. As for _Nitre_, by
mixing of _four Liquors_ together, and then setting them to _shoot_; I
have obtained _Chrystals_ of _true_ and _perfect Salt_; which have had
much of a _nitrous tast_; and would be _melted_ with a _gentle Heat_,
as _Nitre_ is; and even as easily as _Butyr_ it self: I mean not, by
the addition of any sort of _Liquor_, or any other Body, to _dissolve_
it; but only by the _fire_.

8. §. And as for a _Sea-Salt_, that I might _Imitate Nature_ for the
_making_ thereof, I consider’d, That the said _Salt_ is nothing else
but that of _Animals_ and _Vegetables_, freed from its true _Spirit_
and _Sulphur_, and some _Saline particles_, _specifically Animal_ or
_Vegetable_, together with them. For both _Animal_ and _Vegetable_
Bodies being continually carried by all _Rivers_ into the Sea; and many
likewise by _shipwrack_, and divers _other_ ways _immersed_ therein:
they are at last _corrupted_, that is, their _Compounding_ parts are
_opened_ and _resolved_. Yet the _Resolution_ being in the _Water_, is
not made _precipitately_, as it is in the _Air_; but by degrees, and
very _gently_; whence the _Sulphurious_ and other _Volatile_ parts,
in their _Avolation_, make not so much _haste_, as to carry the more
_fixed Saline_ parts along with them; but leaveth them behind in the
_Water_, which _imbibeth_ them as their proper _Menstruum_.

And the _Imitation_ of _Nature_ herein, may be performed thus; Put as
much of a _Lixivial Salt_ as you please, into a wide-mouth’d Bottle,
and with fair _Water_ make a strong _Solution_ of it; so as some part
thereof may remain _unresolved_ at the bottom of the Bottle. Let the
Bottle stand thus for the space of about half or three quarters of a
year, all the time unstopped. In which time, many of the _Sulphurious_
and _other Volatile_ parts gradually flying away; the top of the
_unresolved Salt_ will be _incrustate_, or as it were _frosted_ over,
with many small and hard _Concretions_, which, in their nature, are
become a true _Sea-Salt_. Whereof there is a double Proof; _First_, In
that most of the said _Concretions_ are of a _Cubical_, or very like
_Figure_. Especially on their _upper parts_; because having a _fixed
Body_ for their _Basis_, their _under_ parts, therefore, contiguous
thereto, are less _regular_. Whereas the parts of the _Salt_ in the
Sea, being environed on all sides with a _Fluid_; their _Figure_ is
on all sides _regular_. _Secondly_, In that a strong _Acid Spirit_ or
_Oyl_ being poured upon a _full body’d Solution_ hereof; yet it maketh
herewith no _Ebullition_, which is also the _property_ of _Sea-Salt_.
And thus much for the more _General Imitation_ of _Bodies_.


                           INSTANCE III, & IV.

FROM the aforesaid _Premisses_, and by the aforesaid _Means_, there is
no doubt to be made, but that also the other _sensible Qualities_ of
Bodies may be _Imitated_, as their _Odors_, and _Tasts_. And that not
only the _general_ ones, as _Fragrant_, or _Astringent_: but also those
which are _specifical_ and _proper_ to such a _species_ of Bodies.

2. §. Thus for _Example_, by _mixing Spirit_ of _Nitre_ or _Vitriol_
with _rectified Oyl_ of _Turpentine_, and some other _Vegetable Oyls_,
severally, and in a due _Proportion_ and _Time_, I have _Imitated_ the
_Smells_ of _divers Vegetables_; as of _Tansy_, of _Lignum Rhodium_,
and _others_. And I conclude it feasable, To _Imitate_ the _Tast_ or
_Smell_ of _Musk_, or _Ambergreece_, or _any other_ body in the world.

3. §. Hence also we may be _Taught_, How to _Imitate_ the _Faculties_,
as well as other _Qualities_ of Bodies. The reason is, because even
_these_ have no dependance upon any _substantial Form_: but are the
meer result of _Mixture_; effected by the same _Causes_, whether in
_Nature_ or _Art_; as I think I have made to appear in the foregoing
_Idea_. ♦ _Id. §. 55._ ♦ _Ch. 2. §. 10._ ♦ _Ch. 3. §. 10._ ♦ And as
in the _Premisses_ of this _Discourse_ hath been shew’d.



                               INSTANCE V.

FROM whence, _again_, it is likewise a _Key_ to _Discover_ the _Nature_
of Bodies. For how far soever we can attain to _Mingle_, or to _Make_
them, we may also know _what they are_.

2. §. For Bodies are _mingleable_, either _of themselves_, or by some
_Third_. As to those which _mingle of themselves_, we may certainly
conclude, That there is a _congruity_ betwixt them, in some respect or
other. So upon various Tryals I find, That _Essential Oyls_ do more
easily _imbibe_ an _Acid_, than an _Alkaly_. Whence it is evident,
That there is some _Congruity_ and _Similitude_ betwixt _Essential
Oyls_, and an _Acid_, which there is not betwixt the said _Oyls_ and an
_Alkaly_.

3. §. As to those that mingle only by some _third_; we may also
certainly conclude, That though the _two extreams_ are _unlike_; yet
that they have both of them some _congruity_ with that _third_, by
which they are _united_.

4. §. _Moreover_, We may make a _Judgment_ from the _manner_ or
_Degree_ of _Mixture_. Thus the _Acid Spirit_ of _Nitre_, as is said,
will _coagulate Oyl-Olive_, and render it _consistent_. Whence it might
be thought, That any other strong _Acid_ will do the like; and that
therefore, there is no great difference in the _Nature_ of the said
_Acid Liquors_. But the contrary hereunto, is proved by _Experiment_.
For having _digested_ the same _Oyl_ in the same _manner_, and for a
much _longer_ time, with strong _Oyl_ of _Sulphur_; although it thence
acquired some change of _Colour_, yet not any _Consistence_.

5. §. _Again_, Because the said _Spirit_ of _Nitre coagulates
Oyl-Olive_; it might be expected, it should have the same effect
upon _Oyl_ of _Aniseeds_; or, at least, that if other _Acids_ will
_Coagulate Oyl_ of _Aniseeds_, that this should do it _best_. But
_Experiment_ proveth the contrary. For of all I have tryed, _Oyl_ of
_Vitriol_ is the only _Acid_ that doth it _instantaneously_. _Oyl_
of _Sulphur_, if very strong, will do it; but not so _soon_, nor so
_much Aqua fortis_, and _Spirit_ of _Salt_, for the present, _do not_
at all _touch_ it. And _Spirit_ of _Nitre_ it self will not _coagulate_
it, under _eight_ or _ten_ hours at least.


                              INSTANCE VI.

_LASTLY_, and _consequently_, It is a _Key_ To _Discover_ the
_Medicinal Use_ and _Operation_ of Bodies. Thus, for _Example_, by the
_Imitation_ of _Rosins_ and _Resinous Gums_, we certainly know what
all of them _are_, and _when_, and _wherefore_ to be _used_. For what
are _Mastick_, _Frankincense_, _Olibanum_, _Benzoin_, and _other like
Rosins_, or _Resinous Gums_, for their _principle_ and _predominant_
parts, that is, _quà Rosins_; but Bodies resulting from _Natural_,
in like manner, as I have shewed, they may be made to result, from
_Artificial Mixture_? That is to say, the _Oleous_, and _Acid_
parts of _Vegetables_, being both _affused_ and _mingled_ together,
_per minima_, in some one sort of _Vessels_ in a _Plant_, they thus
_incorporate_ into one _consistent_ and _friable_ Body, which we call
_Rosin_.

2. §. Now from hence it is, That the said _Rosins_, and _Resinous
Gums_; as also _Amber_ and _Sulphur_ for the same Reasons; are of so
great and effectual _Use_ against most _thin_ and _salt Rheums_; _sc._
as they are _Acidoleous_ Bodies. For by their _Acid_ parts, which in
all these Bodies are exceeding _copious_, they _mortifie_ and _refract_
those _Salt_ ones, which feed the _Rheum_. And by their _oleous_ parts,
the same _Salt_ ones are also _Imbibed_. Whence, they are all, in some
degree, _incorporated_ together; that is, The _Rheum_ is _thickned_:
which is the desired _effect_.

3. §. Whereas, on the contrary, if the _Cough_ proceed not from a
_thin_, and specially a _Salt Rheum_, but from a _Viscous Flegm_; the
use of _many other_ Bodies which are also more _oleous_, and abound
not so much with an _Acid_ as _these_ do, especially _some_ of them,
is more proper: such as _these_, in this Case, proving sometimes not
only _ineffectual_, but _prejudicial_. Since the very _Cause_ of the
said _Viscousness_ of _Phlegm_, is chiefly some great _Acidity_ in the
_Blood_, or in some other _part_, as may be proved by divers Arguments.

4. §. Many more _Instances_ might be hereunto subjoyned: and may
hereafter be offered to the acceptance of such, who are inquisitive
into _matters_ of this _Nature_. If I shall not herein anticipate, or
reiterate the _Thoughts_ and _Observations_, of those two _Accurate_
and _Learned Persons_ Dr. _Willis_, and Dr. _Walter Needham_, as
to what the one hath already _published_, and both have put us in
_Expectation_ of. But the _Instances_ already given, are sufficient to
evidence what I have said. And, I hope, this present _Discourse_ to
prove, in some measure, thus much; That _Experiment_, and the _Common
Notions_ of _Sense_ are _prolifick_; and that nothing is _Barren_, but
Phansie and _Imagination_.




               _An Appendix to the precedent discourse of
                                Mixture._


HAVING, in the first Edition of the foregoing Discourse, ♦ _Ch. 5.
Inst. 1. §. 8._ ♦ made mention of the preparation of _Essential Oyls_,
so as to become easily mingleable with any _unoyly Liquor_. I shall
here acquaint the Reader, That this may be done, by digesting any of
the said _Oyls_ with about an equal quantity of the _Yelk_ of an _Egg_,
with a very soft heat, like that of the _Meridian Sun_ in _Summer_,
continued for the space of three Weeks or a Month; and in the mean
time, to be now and then stirred a little together. The _Yelk_ will
by degrees, imbibe the _Oyl_, and at length be incorporated with it,
and become a _Balsam_, as _white_ as _Milk_, easily dissoluble in any
_watery_ or _winy Liquor_.

2. §. I confess, that it will be very difficult to prepare any good
quantity for use, this way. But this being a sufficient proof of the
possibility of such a _Mixture_; I considered, whether the application
of some other forementioned _Cause_ of _Mixture_, might not supply the
defect of this: and hereupon, have made several successful tryals;
not only for the mixing of the said _Oyls_, but likewise of all sorts
of _Rosins_ and _Gums_ with any _winy_ or _watery Liquor_, in great
quantities, in a short time, and without much trouble. But for the
mixing of some of them, the _Yelk_ of an _Egg_ alone will not serve,
without the intervening of some other sociable Body, ♦ _Ch. 5. Inst.
1. §. 6._ ♦ according to one of the _Rules_ given in the foregoing
_Discourse_.

3. §. In the same _Discourse_, upon certain premises, I have laid down
this following conclusion. ♦ _Ch. 5. §. 5._ ♦

     “---- By accumulating the _Causes_ of _Mixture_, that is, by
     joyning two or three or more together; or by applying more in
     some cases, where _Nature_ applyeth fewer; we may be able to
     make, if not a more perfect, yet a far more speedy _Mixture_,
     than _Nature_ doth. As by joyning COMPRESSION, _Heat_, and
     _violent Agitation_, and so continuing them altogether, by
     some means contrived for the purpose, for the space of a
     Week or Month, or longer without _Cessation_. Which may
     probably produce, not only strange, but useful effects, in
     the SOLUTION of some, and the _Mixture_ of other _Bodies_.”

4. §. For the proof whereof, and that I had throughly weighed what I
have said, Mr. _Pappin_ hath since given us an ingenious Instance,
in his new _Digester_. Which is, a _Balneum Mariæ clausum_: all
_Infusions_ and _Digestions_ made with _Double Vessels_, having
hitherto been made with the outer _Vessel_, open. So that whereas by
the old way of _Digestion_, there is no other _Power_ made use of but
that of _Heat_: in this way, that also of _Compression_ is joyned
therewith.

                                   IN

                                 CONSORT

                                 OF THE

                                LUCTATION

                  Arising from the Affusion of several

                               MENSTRUUMS

                            Upon all sorts of

                                 BODIES,

            Exhibited to the _Royal Society_, _April 13._ and
                             _June 1. 1676_.

_THE intent of the following_ Experiments _is two-fold. The one, to be
as a_ Demonstration _of the Truth of one, amongst other_ Propositions,
_laid down in the precedent Discourse of_ Mixture, ♦ _Ch. 5. Inst. 5._
♦ _sc._ That it would be a Key to let us easily into the knowledge of
the Nature of Bodies.

_The other, and that consequently,_ To be as a Specimen of a Natural
History of the Materia Medica: _that is to say, a multifarious Scrutiny
into the intrinsick Properties of all those Materials, which have
been, or may be used in_ Medicine: _for the performance whereof, the
following_ Method _is exhibited as one, amongst others, necessary to
be insisted upon. For what Dominion a_ Prince _hath over the_ Moral,
_that a_ Physician _hath, as one of God Almighty’s_ Vice-Roys, _over
the_ Corporeal _World. Whom therefore nothing can more import, than
a particular knowledge of the_ Genius _of all his_ Subjects, _those
several_ Tribes _of_ Matter, _supposed to be under his Command._

_There are some known_ Observations _of this nature: but there is no
Author, I think, who hath given us a_ Systeme of Experiments upon the
Subject: _The performance whereof is here intended._

_The_ Experiments _may seem too numerous to be of one_ make. _But no
less a number would have answered the design of an_ Universal Survey;
_which, though less pleasing, proves the more instructive in the end:
not being like angling with a single Hook; but like casting a Net
against a shole: with assurance of drawing up something. Besides the
advantage of_ comparing many together; _which being thus joyned, do
oftentimes, like_ Figures, _signifie ten times more, then standing
alone, they would have done._

_How far the_ Corollaries _all along subjoyned have made this good, is
left to the_ Reader _to judge. And also, to add to them, so many more,
as he pleases: for I make my own Thoughts no mans_ Measure.




                                CHAP. I.

  _What is generally to be observed upon the_ Affusion _of the_
     Menstruum; _and what, particularly of_ Vegetable Bodies.


THE Bodies whereupon I made tryal, were of all kinds, _Animal_,
_Vegetable_, and _Mineral_. Amongst _Vegetables_, such as these,
_scil._ _Date-stones_, _Ginger_, _Colocynthis_, _Pyrethrum_,
_Hawthorn-stones_, _Staphisagria_, _Euphorbium_, the _Arenulæ_ in
Pears, _Semen Milii Solis_, _Tartar_, _Spirit_ of _Scurvygrass_,
_Spirit_ of _Wine_, &c.

2. §. Amongst _Minerals_, several sorts of _Earths_, _Stones_, _Ores_,
_Metals_, _Sulphurs_, and _Salts_.

3. §. Amongst _Animals_; such as these, _scil._ _Hairs_, _Hoofs_,
_Horns_, _Shells_, and _shelly Insects_, _Bones_, _Flesh_, and the
several _Viscera_, _Silk_, _Blood_, _Whites_ and _Yelks_ of _Eggs_,
_Sperma Ceti_, _Civet_, _Musk_, _Castor_, _Gall_, _Urine_, _Dungs_,
_animal Salts_ and _Stones_.

4. §. The _Liquors_ which I poured hereupon severally, were these,
_sc._ _Spirit_ of _Salt Armoniac_, _Spirit_ of _Harts-Horn_, _Spirit_
of _Nitre_, _Aqua fortis_, _Oyl_ of _Salt_, _Oyl_ of _Sulphur_, and
_Oyl_ of _Vitriol_; commonly so called.

5. §. In the _Mixture_ of these Bodies, two things, in general, are all
along to be observed, _viz._ _First_, which they are, that make _any_,
or _no Luctation_. For, as some which seem to promise it, make none:
So, many, contrary to expectation, make a considerable one.

6. §. _Next_, the _manner_ wherein the _Luctation_ is made; being with
much variety in these _five_ sensible _Effects_. 1. _Bullition_; when
the Bodies mixed produce only a certain quantity of froth or bubbles.
2. _Elevation_; when, like Paste in baking, or Barm in the working of
Beer, they swell and huff up. 3. _Crepitation_; when, they make a kind
of hissing and sometimes a crackling noise. 4. _Effervescence_; then
only and properly so called, when they produce some degree of heat. 5.
_Exhalation_; when not only fumes, but visible steams are produced.

7. §. Of all these, sometimes one only happens, sometimes two or more
are concomitant. Sometimes the _Luctation_ begins presently upon
mixture, and sometimes not till after some intermission. In some
bodies, it continues a great while; in others, is almost instantaneous:
Examples of all which I shall now produce; beginning with _Vegetables_,
as affording the least variety.

8. §. _And first, if we take Spirit or Oyl of Salt, Oyl of Vitriol,
Spirit of Nitre, or Aqua fortis, and pour them severally upon the
several parts of Vegetables, as Roots, Woods, Stones, &c. we shall
find, that they are, generally far less apt to make a Luctation, than
either Animal, or subterraneal Bodies._ Whence, as from one argument,
it seemeth evident, That in most _Vegetables_, and in most of their
parts, the predominant _Salt_ is an _Acid_. But that, on the contrary,
the predominant _Salt_ in most _Minerals_, and parts of _Animals_,
is an _Alkaly_: in the former, usually a _fixed_; in the latter, a
_volatile Alkaly_.

9. §. _Again, although the Luctation which most Vegetables, and most
of their parts make with Acids, be but small, yet some they make;
especially with some Acids, as with Spirit of Nitre and Aqua fortis._
Whence it seemeth plain, That there is an _Alkaline Salt_ existent in
many _Vegetables_, even in their _natural estate_; and that it is not
made _Alkaline_, but only _Lixivial_, by the _fire_. Or, there is some
quantity of a _Salt_, call it what we will, in the said Bodies, which
is so far different from an _Acid_, as to make a _Luctation_ therewith.
But to give particular instances of the several _proportions_, or
_manner_ of _Mixture_, wherein it appears to be in several _Plants_.

10. §. _And first, of all vegetable Bodies, Date-stones are amongst the
least apt to make a Luctation with Acids, if they may be said to make
any at all._ Hence they are not so potent _Nephriticks_, as many other
Stones, which make a more sensible _Luctation_.

11. §. _Ginger makes a small Bullition_ with _Aqua fortis, only
observable by a Glass_. Hence the _pungency_ of Ginger lyeth in
a _sulphureous_ and _volatile Salt_, which yet is very little
_Alkalizate_.

12. §. _Scurvygrass-seeds make a very small Bullition with Aqua fortis,
like that of Ginger. So doth also the Seed of Purslane._ Hence,
although there is much more of a certain kind of _volatile Salt_ in
Ginger or Scurvygrass, than in _Purslane_; yet there is little more of
an _Alkaly_ in any one, than in an other.

13. §. _The Pulp of Colocynthis, Fruit-Stones, the stony Covers of
the Seeds of Elder, of white Bryony, of Violets, and others, with
Aqua fortis make a Bullition just perceivable without a Glass._
Hence it appears, That the great _Cathartick_ power of _Colocynthis_
lieth not so much in an _Alkaly_, as an _Acid_; as making a much
less _Bullition_, than some other _vegetable Bodies_, which are
less _Cathartick_. For which reason likewise it is, That the best
Correctors, or Refractors of the force of _Colocynthis_, are some kinds
of _Alkalies_, as particularly that of _Urine_, as _Riverius_ hath
somewhere observed.

14. §. _The Root of Pyrethrum, with Aqua fortis, makes a Bullition and
huff, in a short time._ Hence, the Cause of a _durable Heat_, upon the
Tongue, is an _Alkalizate Sulphur_. For the Heat of Ginger, though
_greater_; yet abideth _nothing near so long_ as that of _Pyrethrum_;
which, as is said, maketh also a more sensible _Bullition_ with _Acids_.

15. §. _Kermes-berries, commonly, but ignorantly, so called, with the
said Liquor, huff up to an equal height, but in a somewhat longer
time._ Hence they are gently _astringent_; _scil._ as their _Alkaly_
binds in with some preternatural _Acid_ in the stomach.

16. §. _Hawthorn-stones, with Aqua fortis, huff up equally with the
former Body; but the Bullition is not so visible. The life is also
observable of Medlar-stones._ Hence, as they contain a middle quantity
of an _Alkaly_, they are not insignificantly used against the _Stone_.

17. §. _Seeds of Staphisagria, with Aqua fortis, make a Bullition still
more visible. But it quickly ends._ This confirms what was said before,
_sc._ That the cause of a _durable Heat_ is an _Alkaline Sulphur_;
these Seeds producing a _durable Heat_, as doth the Root of _Pyrethrum_.

18. §. _The Seeds also of red Roses, Borage, and Comfrey do all with
Aqua fortis make a considerable Bullition and huff; and that very
quickly._ So that amongst all Shells and Stones, those generally make
the greatest _Bullition_, which are the hardest and the brittlest, and
so the fullest of _Salt_.

19. §. _Euphorbium makes a Bullition yet more considerable, with much
froth, and very quickly._ From which Experiment, compared with two of
the former, it appears, That _Euphorbium_ is not an _Acid_, but an
_Alkaline Gum_. As also, that the cause of its so very _durable Heat_,
is an _alkaline Sulphur_, as of _Pyrethrum_ and _Staphisagria_ hath
been said. It seems also hence evident, that the power of all great
_Sternutatories_ lyeth not in their _Acid_, but their _Alkalies_.

20. §. _The Arenulæ or little stones in Pears, cluster’d round about
the Coar, with Aqua fortis, presently huff up, and make a great
Bullition and Effervescence, much greater than do any of the Bodies
above-named._ Whence, although, so far as I know, they have never yet
been used in _Medicine_; yet it is probable, that they are a more
potent and effectual _Nephritick_, than any of the Bodies aforsaid,
some of which are usually prescribed. It is hence also manifest, That,
according to what I have elsewhere said, ♦ _Anat._ of _Plants, B. 1.
Ch. 6._ ♦ for the sweetning of the Fruit and Seed, the _Tartareous_ and
_Alkaline_ parts of the _Sap_, are _precipitated_ into their Stones,
stony parts, and Shells.

21. §. _The last Instance shall be in the shells of the Seeds of
Milium Solis; which not only with Aqua fortis, but some other Acids,
make a greater and quicker Bullition and Effervescence, than any
other vegetable Body, upon which I have yet made tryal, in its
natural estate._ Hence, as well as from divers of the last fore-going
Instances, we have a clear confirmation of what I have, towards the
beginning of this Discourse, affected; _sc._ That there is some kind
of _Alkaline Salt_ in _Plants_, even in their _natural estate_. As
also, that they are as significantly used against the Stone, _quatenus
alkalizate_, as _Millipedes_, _Egg-shells_, or any other _testaceous
Bodies_ of the same strength. To these I shall subjoyn one or two
Examples of Vegetable Bodies which are more or less altered from their
_natural estate_.

22. §. _Neither Crystals of Tartar, nor Tartar it self (although
they have some store of alkaline mixed with their acid parts) make
any Effervescence with Acids, but only with Alkalites, as Spirit
of Harts-Horn, &c._ Hence the _calculous sediment_ or _Arenulæ_ in
_Urine_, may not so properly be called the _Tartareous part_ of the
_Urine_; the events following the mixture hereof with the aforesaid
_Salts_, being quite contrary; as will be seen in the _Last Chapter_.

23. §. _Spirit of Scurvy-grass maketh no Luctation with any Acid._
Hence (as from a former Experiment was above-noted) it seems, That
there may be a kind of _volatile Salt_, which is neither _acid_, nor
_alkaline_; such as this of _Scurvygrass_ and other like _Plants_ seems
to be: yet contrary to an _acid_; as experience shews in their efficacy
against the _acid Scurvy_.

24. §. _Rectified Spirit of Wine, both with Spirit of Nitre, and with
Oil of Vitriol, severally, maketh a little Luctation._ Which argues,
that there is contained, even in this Spirit, some portion of a
_volatile Alkaly_.

25. §. _Spirit of Wine, and double Aqua fortis, as the strongest is
called, make an effervescence so vehement, as plainly to boil._

26. §. _Besides the vehemency hereof, there is another surprizing
circumstance. For whereas all other Liquors which make an Effervescence
together, will do it in any proportion assigned, although but one drop
to a thousand: these two,_ sc. _rectified Spirit of Wine and Aqua
fortis, require a certain proportion the one to the other. For if,
suppose, into six drops of Spirit of Wine you put but two or three of
Aqua fortis, they stir no more than if you put in so much Water: but
drop in about seven or eight drops of Aqua fortis, and they presently
boil up with very great vehemency._ Hence we may conceive the reason
of the sudden access of an _acute Disease_, and of its _Crisis_. These
not beginning _gradually with the Cause_; but then, when the _Cause_
is arrived unto such an ἀκμὴ, or such a certain _Proportion_, as is
necessary to bring Nature to the contest. And these may serve for
Examples upon _Vegetables_.




                                CHAP. II.

                   _What may be observed of MINERALS._

HAVING given several Instances of tryal upon _Vegetables_; I next
proceed to _Minerals_, which, for some orders sake, I shall distribute
into five or six sorts, _sc._ _Earths_, _Stones_, _Ores_ and _Metals_,
_Sulphurs_, and _Salts_.

2. §. _First for Earths. Oyl of Vitriol upon Fullers Earth, doth not
stir it, or cause the least Bullition. Nor upon yellow Oker. Nor upon
the Oker which falls from green Vitriol. The same Oyl of Vitriol
and Spirit of Harts-Horn poured severally upon Bolus Armena of two
kinds, and upon one kind of Terra sigillata, stir none of them._ Hence
_Bolus’s_ are the _Beds_, or as it were, the _Materia prima_, both
of opacous _Stones_, and _Metals_; into which the said _Bolus’s_ are
transmuted, by being _concentred_ with divers kinds of _Salts_ and
_Sulphurs_, which successively flow in upon them.

3. §. _Aqua fortis, and Oyl of Vitriol being poured severally upon
another sealed Earth, which was vended by the name of Terra Lemnia;
they both made a very considerable Effervescence herewith._ Whence it
appears, That there is no small difference in the nature, and therefore
the operation of _Bolus Armena_ and _Terra Lemnia_. As also, betwixt
the sealed Earths themselves, one making a great _Effervescence_,
another none at all. Whereto those that use them, are to have regard.

4. §. _Next for Stones. And first, Irish Slat, with Spirit of
Harts-horn, maketh a small, yet visible Bullition: and it presently
ceaseth._ So that it seems to be nothing else but a _Vitriolick Bole_.
As is also argued from its taste, which is plainly acid, and somewhat
rough. Whence also it is with good reason given upon any inward
Bruises. Because by coagulating the Blood, it prohibits its too copious
afflux into the affected part. Yet being but gently astringent, and so
the Coagulations it makes, not great; they are likewise well enough
carried off from the same part in the Circulation; by both which means
an Inflammation may be either prevented, or the better over-ruled.

5. §. _Lapis Hæmatites maketh no Effervescence at all either with
Alkalies or Acids._

6. §. _Powder of the green part of a Magnet with Oyl of Vitriol maketh
some few bubbles, yet not visible without a Glass. But the powder of
the black part of a Magnet, which is the said stone fully perfect,
stirreth not with any acid. Neither doth the calcined Magnet._ Hence
there is some considerable difference betwixt _Iron_ and the _Magnet_.

7. §. _Lapis Lazuli, with Oil of Vitriol, and especially with Spirit of
Nitre, maketh a conspicuous Bullition._ Hence its _Cathartick_ virtue
lyeth in an _Alkaly_. For which reason it is also appropriate, in
like manner as _Steel_, to the cure of _Hypochondriacal Affections_;
originated from some kind of fermenting Acid.

8. §. _Osteocolla, with Spirit of Nitre maketh yet a greater
Effervescence._ How it comes to be so great a knitter of broken Bones,
as it is reputed, is obscure. It seemeth, that upon its solution by a
_Nitrous Acid_ in the body; it is _precipitated_ upon the broken part,
and so becomes a kind of _Cement_ thereto.

9. §. _Lapis Tuthiæ, with Spirit of Nitre, maketh an Effervescence much
alike. And with Oyl of Vitriol very considerably. But Lapis Calaminaris
with Oyl of Vitriol grows stark; as the powder of Alabaster doth with
water. With Spirit of Nitre it maketh a little Bullition, and quickly.
But with Aqua fortis, a great one; beyond any of the Stones above
named._ Hence both _Tutty_ and _Calamy_ are _Ophthalmicks_ from their
_Alkaly_. Which is also confirmed, from the efficacy of some _Alkalies_
of the like use. Hence also _Calamy_ seemeth to partake somewhat of the
nature of _Silver_: as by tryal made upon that also, will hereafter
better appear.

10. §. _Chalk and Oil of Sulphur or Vitriol make as strong an
Effervescence as any of the rest._ Whence it is sometimes well used
against a Cardialgia.

11. §. _Whiting makes as great an Effervescence as Chalk._ So that it
seems the saline parts are not washed away with the water, wherein the
Chalk, for the making of Whiting, is dissolved.

12. §. _Talk will not stir in the least either with Spirit of Nitre, or
Oyl of Vitriol. But the Lead-Spar maketh a considerable Effervescence
with both of them severally._ Hence, however this be also called
_English Talk_, yet there is no small difference betwixt this, and true
_Talk_.

13. §. _To these Stones may be added petrified bodies. As petrified
wood; which (that upon which I made tryal) no acid stirreth in the
least. Petrified shells; upon four or five several sorts whereof,
Oyl of Vitriol being poured, produceth a great Effervescence. The
Root or rougher part of the stone called_ Glossopetra, _with Spirit
of Nitre, makes a conspicuous Bullition._ Asteria, _the Stone so
called, and found in some places in_ England, _with Oyl of Vitriol,
maketh an Effervescence at the same degree. So doth the Belemnites, or
Thunder-Stone, both the larger and the lesser kinds._ So that none of
these are _acid_, or _vitriolick_, but _alkalizate_ Stones.

14. §. _Coraline, with Oyl of Vitriol, makes a conspicuous Bullition,
yet mild and gentle; that is, with very little, if any heat, and
without any visible Fumes. And red and white Coral do the like._ Hence
they are all of a very gentle operation, and fit for Children, as the
case requires.

15. §. _Magistery of Coral (prepared the ordinary way) stirreth not in
the least, either with Alkalies or Acids._ Whence it is evident, That
its active Principles are in its preparation destroyed and washed away:
that is to say, It is an elaborate Medicine good for nothing. And thus
far of Stones.

16. §. _I next come to Metals and Ores. And first for Lead; upon which
Spirit of Salt, Spirit of Nitre, or Aqua fortis being dropped, it
stirreth not in the least with any of them: but with Oyl of Sulphur,
and especially with Oyl of Vitriol it maketh a slow Bullition and
froth._ Hence it seemeth to be _the most alkalizate Metal_. Which is
also confirmed by a foregoing Experiment upon the _Lead-Spar_, which
maketh a considerable Effervescence with any sort of _acid_. And which
likewise, being calcined, yieldeth a good quantity of _Lixivial Salt_.

17. §. _Lead-Ore stirreth not at all with Aqua fortis or Oil of
Vitriol. But Spirit of Salt makes it bubble, and Spirit of Nitre makes
it boil._ Hence there is a considerable difference betwixt the perfect
Metal and the Ore.

18. §. _Burnt Lead and red Lead, make a very small Bullition with Oyl
of Vitriol, with Spirit of Nitre a far greater._

19. §. _Mercury, with Oyl of Vitriol, will not stir, nor with Oyl of
Sulphur. But with Spirit of Nitre presently boyls up._ Hence _Mercury_
is a _subacid Metal_; _Spirit_ of _Nitre_ being a _subalkaline Acid_.

20. §. _The filings of Iron or Steel, with Oyl of Vitriol, make a fair
Bullition, like that of Minium. But Spirit of Nitre makes them boil
with much celerity._ Hence Iron is likewise a _subacid Metal_.

21. §. _Steel prepared with Sulphur maketh a far less Effervescence
with the same Spirit of Nitre, than do the filings._ Hence there is a
great difference in their strength. So that ten grains of the filings
unprepared, will go as far as fifteen grains or more of those which are
prepared, as above-said. Yet in some cases the weaker and milder may be
the better.

22. §. _There is one Circumstance in the mixture of Steel and Aqua
fortis, which is surprizing; and that is this, That strong Aqua fortis,
dropped upon Steel, will not, of it self, make the least Bullition: but
if hereto you only add a drop or two of Water, they presently boil
up with very great vehemency._ The Cause is obscure; yet it is well
known, that _Water_ it self will dissolve _Iron_: so that it appears,
as well by this, as by some other Experiments, that even in common
Water, as mild as it is, there is some kind of corrosive Principle.

23. §. _Antimony with Spirit of Nitre, and Aqua fortis severally,
maketh an Effervescence; somewhat lower than Iron. With Oil of Vitriol
the Bullition is so small, as difficulty to be perceived with a Glass._
Hence it seemeth to be of a very compounded nature; if I may so call
it, a subacid-alkaline Metal.

24. §. _Antimonium Diaphoreticum, with Spirit of Nitre and Oil of
Vitriol severally, makes a considerable Effervescence._ Wherefore it is
not an useless _Preparation_; as from the _Calcination_ and _Ablution_
used therein, some have thought.

25. §. _Bezoardicum Minerale, (that upon which I made tryal) stirreth
not at all either with Alkalies or Acids._ To which, let those who make
use of it, have regard.

26. §. _Tin, with Spirit of Nitre, makes so hot and vehement an
Effervescence, that it turns presently, as it were, into a Coal. It
makes also a fair Bullition with Oyl of Vitriol. And a gentle one with
Spirit of Salt._ Wherefore, it hath something of the nature both of
_Iron_, _Lead_, and _Copper_.

27. §. _The like remarkable circumstance is seen in the mixture of
Aqua fortis with Tin, as with Iron. For Tin and strong Aqua fortis of
themselves will not stir; but add a few drops of water to them, and
they boyl up with the greatest vehemency._

28. §. _Copper, with Spirit of Salt, and Oyl of Vitriol severally,
stirs not at all. Spirit of Nitre, and Aqua fortis, both boil it up
vehemently. Neither Spirit of Harts-horn, nor spirit of Salt Armoniac
maketh any Bullition therewith. But both of them, by a gentle solution,
that is, gently separating its Sulphur from its Salts, turn it blue._
Hence _Copper_ hath a greater proportion of _acid_ than _any_ of the
forementioned _Metals_.

29. §. _Silver, neither with Spirit of Salt, nor Oyl of Vitriol makes
any Bullition. With Spirit of Nitre it makes one, but ’tis soon over:
and then continues to dissolve slowly into white Coagulations. It also
maketh with Spirit of Harts-horn, or of Salt Armoniac, a full and deep
blue._ Hence there is a greater proportion of _acid_ in _Silver_, than
in _Lead_, _Mercury_, _Iron_, _Antimony_, _Tin_, or _Copper_.

30. §. _Litharge of Silver maketh the greatest Effervescence with Oyl
of Vitriol. Yet some with Spirit of Nitre. And with Spirit of Salt
Armoniac maketh some little huff or elevation. And being mixed with
Spirit of Nitre and Spirit of Salt Armoniac both together, produceth a
faint blue._ Hence, although the far greater part of this _Litharge_ be
but _Lead_; yet, it seems, it hath some small mixture of _Silver_. But
that of _Gold_ seemeth, for contrary reasons, not to have any _Gold_.

31. §. _Gold maketh no Effervescence with any single Salt I know of.
But it is commonly dissolved with Aqua Regis, which is known to be
an alkaline Liquor._ Whence it seemeth, That as _Lead_ is the _most
alkalizate_, so _Gold_ the _most acid_ of _Metals_.

32. §. These things considered, and other observations added hereunto,
may possibly give some directions, not only for the ordering and using,
but even for the making, imitating and transmuting of _Metals_. Thus
far of _Metals_.

33. §. _I will next give one or two Instances of tryal upon Sulphurs.
And first Sulphur vive, with Aqua fortis, maketh an apparent Bullition,
but it is some time, before it begins. But the factitious or common
Brimstone, maketh scarce any, if any at all._ So that there is no small
difference betwixt them.

34. §. _White and yellow Arsenick make no Bullition either with
Alkalies or Acids._ Wherefore the strength of its operation on the
Body, lies more in a _Sulphur_ than a _Salt_; or in a Salt drowned in
its _Sulphur_.

35. §. _The ashes either of Pit-Coal, or Sea-Coal, make no Effervescence
with Alkalies or Acids._ Whence the saline Principle is altogether
volatile, and sublimed away by the fire.

36. §. _Lastly for Salts. And first of all, Borax maketh no
Effervescence nor any Fumes with Oyl of Vitriol or Spirit of Nitre._

37. §. _Oyl of Vitriol and Nitre make fumes or steams, though no
Effervescence._

38. §. _Green Vitriol, with Spirit of Harts-Horn, is scarcely moved.
White Vitriol, with the same Spirit, maketh a conspicuous huff. And
Roman Vitriol a vehement Effervescence._ Whence the _former_ is the
_least acid_, and the _latter the most of all_. Which also confirms
what I said before of the like natures of the several _Metals_ to which
they belong.

39. §. _Salt of Vitriol, though a fixed Salt, and made by Calcination,
yet maketh no Effervescence with the strongest acid; but only with
Alkalies; as may be seen upon their mixture, but much better heard by
holding the mixture to ones ear._ Hence, there are _fixed Acids_. Which
further confirms what I have above asserted concerning the nature of
_Gold_, _sc._ That the _predominant Salt_ thereof is a _fixed Acid_.

40. §. _Sal Martis, with Spirit of Harts-horn, maketh a considerable
huff._ Hence it is much more _acid_ than _green Vitriol_; and is
therefore a cooler body.

41. §. _Alum and Spirit of Harts-horn make a plain Effervescence._

42. §. _Saccharum Saturni, with Oyl of Vitriol, stirs not at all. With
Spirit of Salt, huffs a little. With Spirit of Nitre much more._ Hence
the _acid_ of the _Vinegar_, and not the _Alkaly_ of the _Lead_, is the
predominant Principle.

43. §. _Common Salt stirs neither with Spirit of Salt, nor with Spirit
of Nitre; nor with Aqua fortis. But with Oyl of Vitriol it maketh a
great Effervescence with noise and steams._ Hence, even common Salt,
though it be not reckoned amongst _alkaline Salts_, yet is far nearer
in nature to _that_, than to an _acid_. Hence also the _Spirit of Salt_
is a _subalkaline Acid_, and of a very different nature from _Oyl_ of
_Sulphur_ or _Vitriol_.

44. §. _Salt Armoniac, with Spirit of Nitre, stirreth not. But with Oyl
of Vitriol it maketh a great Effervescence._ Hence _Spirit of Nitre_ is
a _subalkalizate Spirit_.

45. §. _Oyl of Vitriol and Spirit of Nitre, though both acids, yet make
a great smoak; greater than that which the Spirit maketh of it self._
Which confirms the last precedent _Corollary_.

46. §. _Oyl of Vitriol and Spirit of Salt, though both acids, yet make
a strong Effervescence, with noise and fumes._ Which further confirms,
what was noted before, _sc._ that Spirit of Salt is a _subalkaline
Acid_.

47. §. _Spirit of Salt Armoniac, with Oyl of Vitriol, makes an
Effervescence so extraordinary quick, and as it were instantaneous,
that nothing seemeth quicker._ Whence it is probable, That if
_Gun-powder_ were made of _Salt Armoniac_, instead of _Nitre_, or with
_both_ mixed together; it would be _far stronger_, than any kind now in
use. And thus far for _Minerals_.

48. §. I have only one _Corollary_ to add, from the whole; which is,
That whoever doth undertake the _Natural History_ of a _Country_,
(such as that the Learned Dr. _Plot_ hath exceedingly well done of
_Oxfordshire_) the foregoing _Method_, seemeth so easie, cheap, and
indeceitful, for the finding out and well distinguishing the natures of
all kinds of _Metalls_, _Ores_, _Salts_, _Earths_, _Stones_, or other
_subterraneal Bodies_; as cannot, I think, be supply’d, but by others
of greater difficulty and expence.




                               CHAP. III.

             _What may be observed of the PARTS of_ Animals.

I NOW proceed to the several _Parts_ of _Animals_; as _Hairs_, _Hoofs_,
_Horns_, _Shells_ and _shelly Insects_, _Bones_, _Flesh and the several
Viscera_, _Silk_, _Blood_, _Eggs_, _Musk_, _Castor_, _Gall_, _Urine_,
_Dungs_, _Salts and Stones_.

2. §. _And first of all, the Hair of a mans head, with Oyl of Vitriol,
maketh no Bullition at all. Nor yet with Spirit of Nitre._ So that
although it contains a good deal of _volatile Salt_; yet it seemeth
either not to be _alkaline_, or else is _centred_ in so great a
quantity of _Oyl_, that the _acid menstruum_ cannot reach it.

3. § _Hares Fur, with spirit of Nitre, maketh, although a short,
yet very plain Bullition and huff._ Hence the _Hair_, and therefore
the _Blood_, of some _Animals_, is fuller of _Salt_, at least of an
_Alkaline Salt_, than that of some others. And perhaps the _Hair_ of
some men, as of _Black’s_, may be so full of _Salt_, as to make a
Bullition like _Hares Fur_.

4. §. _The shavings of Nails stir not at all, either with Oyl of
Vitriol, or Spirit of Nitre: only with the latter they turn yellow. But
Elks Claws, with Spirit of Nitre, make a small and slow Bullition._

5. §. _Horses Hoof, with Oyl of Vitriol, stirs not of many hours.
But with Spirit of Nitre, allowing it some time, makes a very plain
Bullition, and huffs up very high._

6. §. _Cows Horn, neither with Oyl of Vitriol, nor with Spirit of
Nitre, maketh any Bullition, only turneth a yellow colour._

7. §. _Rams Horn stirs not with Oyl of Vitriol; but with Spirit of
Nitre, makes a small and slow Bullition._

8. §. _Harts-Horn makes a considerable Bullition and huff, even with
Oyl of Vitriol, which the rest of the Bodies abovesaid, will not do.
But with Spirit of Nitre, it makes yet a greater._ From the foregoing
Experiments, and almost all that follow, what is before asserted of the
_Salts_ of _Vegetables_ and _Minerals_, is here also evident concerning
that of _Animals_, _scil._ That it is not _made_, but only _separated_
by the fire. It likewise hence appears, That the _proportion_ of _Salt_
in the forementioned _parts_ is very different; and that therefore
some of them are never, and none of them but with good discretion, to
be substituted one for another in Medicine. As also, that there is a
different proportion of _Salt_ in the several _Animals_ themselves, to
which the said _Parts_ belong.

9. §. _Next for shells; as those of Lobsters, Eggs, Snails and Oisters:
all which make an Effervescence, both with Oyl of Vitriol, and Spirit
of Nitre. But with Spirit of Nitre the greatest. Lobster-shells make a
considerable Bullition and huff, but no noise nor steams. Egg-shells
make a Bullition and huff, with some noise, but no steams. Snail-shells
make an Effervescence with noise and steams. Oyster-shells make one
with the gratest noise and thickest steams._ Hence we may judge, in
what case to administer _one_ more appositely than _another_. As also
_in what proportion_, according to their different strength. Some
may be better for _Children_, as being milder. Or for a Body whose
very sharp _Blood_ or other _Humors_, are more easily kindled into
_Ferments_. Or else may be safest, to avoid a sudden _precipitation_ of
the _Humors_; or for some other cause.

10. §. _Oyster-shells, and the rest above-said, make a quicker
Effervescence, not only with Spirit of Nitre, but even with Spirit of
Salt, than they do with Oyl of Sulphur, or Oyl of Vitriol._ So that
_these bodies_, as well as _Metals_, have their proper _Menstruums_
whereby they are be dissolved.

11. §. _Egg-shells calcined, make with Oyl of Sulphur, or Oyl of
Vitriol, or Spirit of Nitre, a greater Effervescence, than when
uncalcined. As also with steams, which uncalcined, they produce
not. The like is seen in calcined Oyster-shells. And the longer
the Calcination is continued, the quicker and stronger will be the
Effervescence. This I tryed at several terms, from a quarter of an
hour, to five hours. So that after so long a Calcination, they make
an Effervescence almost instantaneous._ The reason hereof is, Because
the several _Principles_ whereof the _Shells_ consist, being relaxed,
and the _Sulphur_ for the greatest part, driven away by the fire; the
remaining _Salt_ lies now more open and naked to the attaque of the
_Menstruum_, so soon as ever they are mixed together. From hence it is
plain, That _Egg-shells_, and the others above-said, being _burnt_, are
far _stronger_ Medicines, than when _unburnt_. It is hereby likewise
evident, That a great portion of their _Salt_, is not a _volatile_,
but a _fixed Alkaly_. To these may be subjoyned all kinds of shelly
_Insects_. I will instance in three or four.

12. §. _And first Bees, with Oyl of Vitriol, stir not in the least.
With Spirit of Nitre they make an exceeding small Bullition, without
any elevation._

13. §. _Cochinele_ (the _Nest_ of an _Insect_) _makes some Bullition
with Oyl of Vitriol, but very small: for the bubbles are not to be
seen without a Glass. But with Spirit of Nitre the Bullition is more
visible, and joyned with some elevation._

14. §. _Cantharides make no visible Bullition with Oyl of Vitriol. But
with Spirit of Nitre they do, and huff up rather more than Cochinele.
Yet is this done very slowly, and comparatively with many other bodies,
is not much._ Hence it is not the _quantity_, but the _quality_ of
their _volatile Salt_, which makes them so strong an _Epispastick_.
For most of those Bodies above, and hereafter named, make a greater
_Bullition_, and yet are neither _Caustick_ nor _Epispastick_ in the
least. It is hence also evident, as hath been before suggested, That
there are divers kinds of _Volatile Salts_, eminently different; some
being highly _alkaline_, others very _little_, and some scarce any
thing so: such as those of _Scurvy-grass_, _Anemone_, _Crowfoot_, and
many the like _Plants_; to whose _Salts_, this of _Cantharides_ seemeth
to be very near of kin.

15. §. _Millepedes make a Bullition and huff, much greater and quicker,
than any of the Insects above-named: and that both with Spirit of
Nitre, and Oyl of Vitriol it self. Yet is this Insect of a very
temperate nature._ Whereby is further demonstrated, That the being
_simply alkaline_, is not enough to make a body to be _Caustick_.

16. §. _Again, although Millepedes make a Bullition, greater than any
of the Insects above named: yet is it much less, than that of Oyster,
Snail, or even Egg-shells; and of divers other bodies above, and
hereafter mentioned._ Hence, being given to the same intent, as any of
those bodies; it is the mildest and gentlest in its operation of them
all.

17. §. _Millepedes likewise calcined, makes a stronger Effervescence,
than when uncalcined, as do the Oyster-shells, &c._ So that it appears,
That _all Testaceous Salts_, are at least in part, _fixed Salts_.

18. §. _I next proceed to Bones. And first Whale-bone maketh no
Bullition at all with any acid. A Cartilage, with Spirit of Nitre,
makes some very small bubbles, not to be seen without a Glass._

19. §. _The Bone in the Throat of a Carp, makes a little and slow
Bullition with Spirit of Nitre. The Spina of a Fish (that which I used
was of a Cod-fish) maketh a Bullition one degree higher._

20. §. _All sorts of Teeth, as Dogs, Boars, the Sea-horse, Elephant,
make the like. As also the Bone of an Oxes heart._ So that all these
are very gentle in their operation, and fit for _Children_.

21. §. _Sheeps and Calves Bones both of them make a Bullition yet a
little higher, especially with Spirit of Nitre. Cocks Bones somewhat
higher than the former. Cranium humanum a little higher than all the
rest._

22. §. _Bones likewise, being calcined, make a Bullition with Acids.
And so doth also calcined Harts-Horn. But in neither of them, is the
Bullition advanced by Calcination, any thing comparable to what it is
in shells._ Whence it appears, That the _Salt_ of _Horns_ and _Bones_,
is much more _volatile_, than that of _Shells_.

23. §. _Next for Flesh and the several Viscera. And first, dryed and
powdered Mutton, with Oil of Vitriol, stirs not at all. But with
Spirit of Nitre makes a small Bullition and huff. Sheeps Heart doth
the like somewhat more apparently. Vipers flesh produceth a froth, but
huffs not, Powdered Earthsworms make a great froth, and huff a little.
Powdered Tripe makes only a little Bullition. Lamb-stones do the like.
Kidney, Spleen, and Liver, with some elevation. Lungs, with bubbles
very large; because extraordinary slowly. Dryed Brain makes also a
little and slow Bullition._ Hence there is a greater proportion of
_Sulphur_ or _Oyl_, and less of _an Alkaly in all these parts_, than
there is in _Bones_, _Shells_, and divers other _parts_ hereafter
mentioned. And in some of them, as in the _Brain_, that _Alkaline Salt_
which there is, may rather be lodged in some _sanguineous_ parts mixed
with them, than in their own proper substance.

24. §. I proceed to instance in all sorts of Animal _Contents_. _And
first, raw Silk, with Spirit of Nitre, makes a very small Bullition,
but the elevation is considerable._

25. §. _The grumous part of the Blood dryed, with Oyl of Vitriol, stirs
but little. But with Spirit of Nitre it huffs up considerably._

26. §. _Serum of Blood dryed, with the same Spirit makes a plain
elevation, with a little Bullition. Herewith may be reckoned the White
of an Egg, which is nothing but a pure Crystlalline Serum separated
from the common stock. This being dryed, with Spirit of Nitre, huffs
up rather more than even the grumous part of the Blood, the Bubbles
are much larger, break oftner, and the elevation sooner made._ Whence
it seemeth, that there is a greater quantity of a _volatile Alkaly_ in
proportion to the _Sulphur_, requisite to the _Generation_, than to the
_Nutrition_ of an _Animal_.

27. §. _The Yelk of an Egg is scarce moved with spirit of Nitre,
producing only a very few Bubbles._ The _Salt_ being either little
_alkalizate_, or else _immersed_ in so great a quantity of _Oyl_, that
the _Menstruum_ cannot reach it. _For the same reason Sperma Ceti stirs
not with any Acid. Neither doth Civet._

28. §. _Russian Castor, with Oyl of Vitriol, stirs not. But with
Spirit of Nitre makes a considerable huff and froth. Yet it requires
time._ Wherefore it seemeth, That _Castor_ by virtue of its _alkaline
sulphur_, becomes so good a _Corrector_ of the _acid-alkaline sulphur_
of _Opium_; so I take leave to call it, having some reasons to believe
it such.

29. §. _Musk, with Oyl of Vitriol, stirs not. But with Spirit of Nitre
it makes a considerable and quick Bullition, with large bubbles, which
often break and rise again._ Whence there is a very eminent difference
betwixt _Musk_ and _Civet_. Hence also, _Musk_ is Cordial, not only
from its _Sulphur_, but its _Alkaly_; by both directly opposite to
preternatural _Acidities_.

30. §. _Dryed Gall with Spirit of Nitre, for some time, is still: but
at length it makes a considerable Bullition and froth._ The reason why
it is so long before it begins, is because the _Salt_, (as was observed
of some other _Parts_) is locked up in so great a quantity of _Oyl_.
The abundance whereof is manifest, not only from _Destillation_, but
also from hence, In that the dryed _Powder_, in lying by, incorporateth
all together into one body, as _Mirrh_, and some other softer and oily
_Gums_ are used to do.

31. §. _Extract of Urine, with Spirit of Nitre, makes a Bullition with
some Effervescence, which continues for a considerable time; and at
last it huffs up with great bubbles. The Bullition begins presently:
the Salt being copious, and the Oyl but little._

32. §. _The same Extract of Urine makes a considerable Bullition and
froth, not only with Spirit of Nitre, but even with Oyl of Vitriol._
Hence the _Salt_ of _Urine_ is more _alkaline_ than that in most
of the afore-said _Contents_. From this and some of the following
_Experiments_, it also appears, That the _Salt_ which concurs to the
generation of _Gravel_ or of a _Stone_ in the _Kidneys_ or _Bladder_,
is of a very different nature from the _Salt_ of _Urine_.

33. §. _Next for Dungs. And first, dryed Goats-dung makes with Spirit
of Nitre, a small Bullition, but no elevation. That of Mice the like.
And that of Cows. So that of all I have tryed, these three stir the
least._

34. §. _Goose-dung, with Spirit of Nitre, makes a very small Bullition
and some elevation. But it requires time. Oyl of Vitriol stirs it not._

35. §. _Album Græcum, with Spirit of Nitre, besides innumerable small
bubbles, rises up with some great ones, exactly resembling the huffing
up of Yest or Barm. Also with Oyl of Vitriol it maketh some little
froth, but slowly._ So that it should seem, that the _Bones_ are a
little _opened_ by some _acid Menstruum_ in the Dogs stomach (as the
body of _Steel_ is in its preparation with _Sulphur_) whereby it
becomes a good mild _Topick_ in _Quinzies_.

36. §. _Hens dung, with Spirit of Nitre, makes a very great bullition
and huff: greater and quicker, than any of the rest above-named._

37. §. _But of all I have tryed, Pigeons dung, with the same Spirit,
maketh the greatest and the quickest Effervescence and huff; and that
not without steams. Yet neither the same Dung, nor that of Hens,
is moved in the least with Oyl of Vitriol._ The Cause of so great
an _Effervescence_ in these, more than in the rest, is that _white
part_ which is here mixed in a great quantity with the _Dung_. Which
_white part_, descendeth not from the _Stomach_, but is an _Excrement_
separated from the _Blood_ (as the _Urine_ in other _Animals_) by a
peculiar _Organ_, which evacuates it into the _Intestinum rectum_;
whence, together with the _Stercus_ it is excluded. Hence it is
evident, That in the said _white part_ of _Hens_, and especially
_Pigeons dung_, is contained a great quantity of a _volatile Alkaly_.

38. §. _I proceed to Salts. And first Salt of Blood and Urine both make
a more durable Effervescence with Acids, than doth Salt of Wormwood, or
Salt of Fern._ Hence the former are more _alkaline_, than the latter.

39. §. _Again, though divers other Animal Salts will not stir with
Spirit of Salt, or with Oyl of Sulphur or Vitriol; yet the Salt of
Blood will make an Effervescence with all kinds of Acids._ Whence it
is further argued to be highly _alkaline_, and very proper for the
_correction_, of all sorts of _preternatural Acids_ in the body. There
is little doubt, but that _Spirit_ of _Harts-horn_ will do the like.

40. §. _The Gravel which is precipitated out of Urine; with Oyl of
Vitriol makes no bullition in the least. Nor with strong Spirit of
Salt. But with Spirit of Nitre, it makes a very great one, with
Effervescence and steams._ From hence it appears, That there is much
difference to be made in the use of _acid Diureticks_, _Nephriticks_,
&c.

41. §. And that I may not altogether omit to mention, what may be so
much for the good of mankind, I do here declare, That for preventing (I
say not, the breaking, but preventing) the generation of the _Stone_,
either in the _Kidneys_, or in the _Bladder_, there are not better
_Medicines_ in the world, than some certain _Preparations_ of _Nitre_,
duly administred. Whoever shall think that any kind of _acid_, as _Oyl
of Sulphur_, _Oyl of Vitriol_, _Spirit of Salt_, or the like, will have
the same effects, will find themselves much deceived in their practice.

42. §. _I conclude with Stones. And first, Spirit of Nitre droped upon
a Stone of the Kidneys or Bladder, produceth the very same effect, as
upon the Gravel in Urine. That is to say, it makes it boil and huff
up, until at length it is perfectly dissolved into a soft Pulp; which
neither Oyl of Sulphur, nor Oyl of Vitriol, nor Spirit of Salt will
do; nor give the least touch towards its dissolution._ This confirms
what said before of the use of _Nitre_ and _Nitrous Spirits_, if duly
prepared and administred, above any other _Acids_, against the breeding
of the _Stone_.

43. §. _Pearls, with any Acid, make the like Effervescence, as do
Oyster-shells. But Magistery of Pearls, as usually prepared, stirs not
at all, with any Alkaly or Acid._ So that as to the effect frequently
intended by it, it is very insignificant; as of that of _Corals_ hath
been said.

44. §. _Crabs Eyes, with any Acid, make an Effervescence, almost as
quick as that of Oyster-shells._

45. §. _Crabs Eyes likewise calcined, make a stronger Effervescence,
than when uncalcined._ So that _these_, as well as _Shells_, contain a
_fixed Alkaly_.

46. §. _The Stones in Whitings heads make a strong Effervescence like
that of Oyster-shells._

47. §. _Stone of humane Gall, Stirs not with Oyl of Vitriol. But with
Spirit of Nitre maketh a little bullition just upon mixing, and after
a considerable time, a little froth. Much less than what was observed
before of the Gall it self._ So that it seemeth to be generated of
the _Gall coagulated_ by some _Acid_, which hath already _refracted_
the _Alkaly_ wherewith the _Gall_ abounds. This confirms the use of
those _Medicines_ in the _Jaundies_, or any other bordering _Disease_,
which destroys those _Acidities_ by which the _Gall_ is _curdled_ or
_coagulated_, and so rendred more difficulty separable into the _Guts_.

48. §. Since the first publishing of these Observations, Mr. _William
Matthews_ an _Apothecary_ in _Ledbury_, sent me part, as I take it, of
a _Stomach-stone_, as big as a _Wallnut_ of the largest Size, voided
by a woman about 82 years of age, sometime after an _Autumn Fever_. It
consisteth of the same _Striæ_, as the _Bezoar Stone_; and maketh some
_Bullition_ with _Spirit_ of _Nitre_.

49. §. _Bezoar, neither the Western nor the Eastern, doth stir at all
with Oyl of Vitriol._

50. §. _Western Bezoar, with Spirit of Nitre, makes a very little thin
froth, and that’s all; and that it doth very slowly. But Oriental
Bezoar, with Spirit of Nitre, after some time, maketh a very great
Effervescence, froth, elevation, noise, and steams (as if you poured
Oyl of Vitriol upon Salt of Tartar) till it be wholly dissolved by
the affused Spirit, and turned into almost a blood-red._ Hence it may
seem to be no mean _Remedy_ against such _fretting_ and _venenate
acids_, as oftentimes in _Fevers_, and other _Distempers_, lye about
the _Stomach_, and are thence frequently translated to the _Heart_,
_Brain_, _Nerves_, and other _parts_. The difference likewise betwixt
the _Western_ and the _Eastern Bezoar_, is so great, that in any case
of danger, and where the _Bezoar_ is relyed upon, it is an unpardonable
fault, for the _Apothecary_, or any _Person_, to _substitute_ the one
for the other: unless he will take _ten times_ as much, or _ten times_
as little of the one, as he would have done of the other: if that will
serve turn.

51. §. The _Stones_ already mentioned, (except the great _Stomach-stone_)
are ordinarily generated in the bodies of _Animals_. I have one
Instance more of some other _Stones_ which are extraordinary. In the
City of _Hereford_ lives a Maid, who often voids these _Stones_, and
in the space of some years last past, hath voided several pounds, of
several _Colours_ and _Sizes_, not only _per vias urinarias_, but also
by vomit, and by stool. The first mention made to me of them, was by
Mr. _Diggs_, a worthy Gentleman of that City, as a thing that was there
much wondred at. And some of them, upon my desire, were sent me by
Mr. _Wellington_, an Apothecary in the same place. _I have tryed what
several acid Menstruums will work upon them; and find, That with Oyl of
Vitriol, and especially with Spirit of Nitre the great ones make a very
quick and conspicuous Effervescence. But the small ones, neither the
white, nor the grey, make any Bullition in the least:_ for in truth,
they are no other but little _Pebbles_ and _Grit-stones_.

52. §. This being considerd, and the various _colours_ and _mixture_ of
any one of the great _Stones_, being well observed; it seemeth plain,
That although she be somewhat old (above thirty years) yet may she
have a kind of μαλακία, or _diseased Appetite_ to _Stones_, _Bones_,
_Wood-ashes_, _Tobacco-Pipes_, _Chalk_, and such like things; which
sometimes swallowing in little _lumps_, sometimes grosly, or finely
ground betwixt her teeth; they are in her _Stomach_ and _Bowels_, more
or fewer of them, _cemented_ together, either with a _pituitous_,
_bilious_, or some other more or less _glutinous substance_. And that
by virtue also of the said _Cement_, or any of the said, or other like
_alkalizate Bodies_, the greater _Stones_, which consist of those
partly, do make an _Effervescence_ with _acid Liquors_. Thus far of
_Instances_ upon the _parts_ of _Animals_. I shall close with some
_Corollaries_ deduced from the whole.

53. §. And first, since we find, that amongst all the _Menstruums_ we
have made use of, _Spirit_ of _Nitre_, or any very _Nitrous Spirit_,
is the most _universal dissolver_ of all kinds of _Animal Bodies_; the
_best dissolver_ of many others both _Vegetable_ and _Mineral_, and
the _only dissolver_ of some: Hence it is probable, That the great
_stomachick Menstruum_, which either _dissolves_, or _opens_ almost all
_Bodies_ which come into the _Stomach_, is a kind of _Nitrous Spirit_.

54. §. Again, _Spirit_ of _Nitre_ being a _subalkaline Acid_, and
working more evidently upon _Animal bodies_, than other _simpler Acids_
do, which yet are as _strong_; It hence follows, That most of the
_Salts_ of _Animals_ are _subacid Alkalies_. How far this _conclusion_
may further instruct us, I shall have occasion to shew in another
_Discourse_.

55. §. Lastly, there being so many, say twenty or thirty _degrees_,
from the _slowest_ to the most _vehement_, in the _Bullition_ of _mixed
Bodies_; it seemeth, That _Fermentation_ it self, as to the _formal
notion_ of it, is nothing else: or that from the common _Luctation_ of
_mixed Bodies_ whereof we have now been speaking, it differs not _in
specie_, but only in the manner of its _causation_, and in _degree_:
the _Aer_, or some certain _Menstruum_ lodged therein, being of no
greater _strength_, than to produce a _Bullition_ or _Luctation_ of
that _low_ and _soft degree_, which we call _Fermentation_.

56. §. I have thus endeavoured to prove, by various _Instances_, how
instructive this most easie, plain and simple _Method_ in the _Mixture_
of _Bodies_, may become to us: and that meerly by observing the
_Luctations_ which thence arise betwixt them. How much more then, if
a diligent remarque be made of all those various _Colours_, _Smells_,
_Tastes_, _Consistencies_, and other _Mutations_ thereupon emergent?

             _Of the QUANTITIES afforded by several_ Plants
                          _calcined in gross._

IT is the part of a _Physician_, knowingly and artificially to use and
govern _Nature_. And therefore by every likely _Method_, to inspect the
_State_ and _Properties_ of all sorts of _Bodies_. One _Method_, is
that I have taken in the foregoing _Experiments_; _sc._ by mixing them
with several _Menstruums_ or _Liquors_: whereby we may be assisted to
judge, both of the _Kinds_ and the _Proportions_ of _Principles_ in any
_Body_; and of the manner of their _Mixture_ in the same.

Another is by _Calcining_ them; or, as it were, by _mixing_ them with
the _Fire_, a potent and almost universal _Menstruum_. I shall here
only set down some _Tryals_ for an _Essay_, upon _Plants_; chiefly
noting, The different _Proportions_ of their _Lixivial Salts_. Of these
_Tryals_, some were made upon the whole _Plant_, or some _Portion_ of
it wherein several _Parts_ are mixed together: And others, upon some
one _Part_ of a _Plant_ distinct from the rest. All of them answering
to such _Queries_, as may seem proper to be proposed.

Query 1. As first, _Whether Trees or Herbs and Bushes, quantity for
quantity_ & cæteris paribus, _yield the most Lixivial Salt?_

For this I took _Ash-Barque_ and _Rosemary_ of each ℔j. The latter
yielded 5 _Scruples_; the former but 32 _Grains_; which is three times
less. I took also the same quantity of the _Barque_ of _Black-Thorn_,
and of _Agrimony_. The latter yielded 5 _Scruples_ and 6 _Grains_; the
former, not above 1 _Scruple_ and 5 _Grains_; which is four times less.

Although the _Barque_ of a _Tree_ be compounded of _Pithy_ and _Lignous
Parts_; yet to answer the _Query_ exactly, the _Wood_ of these _Trees_
should be taken with the _Barque_, that there may be some portion of
every _Part_ of the _Tree_, as well as of the _Herb_.

But thus far the _Experiment_ is _conclusive_, That the same quantity
of _Lixivial Salt_, doth not always follow the same _Generical Tast_.
For the _Barque_ of _Ash_ and _Rosemary_, are both equally _Bitter_;
and the _Barque_ of _Black-Thorn_ and _Agrimony_ are both _Astringent_
and _Bitter_.

Quer. 2. _Whether any Plant growing in a Garden or the Field, doth not
yield a lesser quantity of Lixivial Salt, than another of the same
kindred growing on the Sea-Coast; and with what difference?_

For this, I took _Garden_ and _Sea-Scurvygrass_, of each ℔j. The former
yields 2 _Drachms_ and 1 _Scruple_; the latter, being well washed, 9
_Drachms_, which is more than 4 times as much. The like may be tryed
upon others.

Quer. 3. _Whether the same Specifick Plant affords more Lixivial Salt,
being only dryed, and then calcin’d, or after it hath first been
distilled, it is then dryed and calcin’d?_

For this, was taken ℔j of _Mint_ only dryed and then calcin’d; and
another first distilled. The former yielded ½ an Ounce and ½ a Drachm
of _Salt_; the latter, 5 Drachms and a Scruple; which is almost ⅕ᵗʰ
more. This also should be tryed on other _Plants_.

Quer. 4. _How far the proportion follows the different Tasts of
Plants?_ The first Experiment, relates to the same _Tast_ in several
_Plants_; this, to several Tasts. And so,

Of _Majorane_, which is _Aromatick_, ℔j affords but one Scruple of
_Lixivial Salt_; which is but the 384ᵗʰ part of the whole pound.

Of _Oak-Barque_ which is _Astringent_, ℔j yields ½ a Drachm of _Salt_;
or the 256ᵗʰ part of the whole.

Of _Liquirish_, which is sweet, ℔j yields about the same quantity. But
_Anise Seeds_ ℔j yields 2 Scruples or a 192ᵈ part.

Of _Sorrel_, which is sower, ℔j yields one Drachm, or the 128ᵗʰ part.

Of _Garden Scurvygrass_, which is _Hot_, ℔j yields 2 Drachms and ½ a
Scruple; or the 59ᵗʰ part.

Of _Mint_, which is _Hot_ and _Bitter_, ℔j yields 5 Drachms and a
Scruple, or the 24ᵗʰ part.

Of _Sea Scurvygrass_, which is _Salt_, ℔j yields 9 Drachms and a
Scruple or 28 Scruples; which is near 1/13ᵗʰ part of the whole. A
greater proportion of _Salt_, than in any other _Plant_ upon which I
have hitherto made Tryal: Or even in _Tartar_ it self. Yet is it not
a _Marine_, but true _Lixivial Salt_: as is evident, both from its
_Taste_; and in that it maketh an _Effervescence_ with _Spirit_ of
_Salt_; which _Sea-Salt_ will not do.

For the Experiment to be fully adequate to the _Query_; the _Tryals_
should be made, either all on _Trees_, or all on _Herbs_; all on
_Roots_, or all on _Stalks_, &c. Yet thus much is evident, That
_Sorrel_ yields Thrice as much as _Majorane_; _Sea-Scurvygrass_, Eight
and Twenty times as much: _Mint_, Five times as much as _Sorrel_; and
Sixteen times as much _Majorane_, &c.

Quer. 5. _How far the Proportion follows the Faculties of Plants?_ And
so, it appears, that

_Majorane_, a _Cephalick_, hath a greater _Proportion_ of _Volatile
Parts_, than any of the _Plants_ above mentioned, and so far, is more
agreeable to the _Animal Spirits_, and _Genus Nervosum_.

_Agrimony_,[76] an _Aperient_, yields above Five times as much
_Lixivial Salt_, as _Majorane_. Yet much less than many other opening
_Plants_ which are stronger.

     [76] _Quer. 1._

_Mugwort_ (℔j) yields two Drachms and two Scruples; or above half
as much more as _Agrimony_. So that this _Plant_, though it hath no
considerable _Taste_, and in that respect promiseth but little; yet
yielding a good quantity of _Lixivial Salt_, seems no contemptible
_Medicine_ to subdue those _Acidities_ which either by causing
_Obstructions_, or immoderate _Fermentations_, frequently disorder the
_Female Sex_.

_Mint_, yieldeth still a greater quantity; and is therefore, partly for
the same cause so excellent a _Stomachick_: And _Rosemary_,[77] which
is appropriated both to the _Head_ and _Stomach_, yieldeth a midle
quantity of _Salt_; more than the chief _Cephalicks_, and less than the
chief _Stomachicks_.

     [77] _Quer. 1._

_Common Mallow_ (℔j) yields 5 Drachms and 2 Scruples. _i. e._ the 23ᵈ
part of the whole. So that this _Plant_, though of a very mild _Taste_,
yet yields more _Salt_ than _Mint_ it self a _Bitter Plant_. Whereby it
no longer seems strange, that a _Plant_ of so soft a _Taste_, should be
very _Diuretick_, and so evidently affect the _Reins_.

_Rhubarb_ (2 Ounces) yieldeth scarce any fixed _Salt_, so for as can be
judged by the _Taste_ of the _Ashes_, not more than a Grain or two. So
that its _Salt_ is, in a manner, wholly volatile; and thereby apter to
operate upon the _Bilious_ parts of the _Blood_; which contein a far
greater proportion of _Volatile Salt_, than do the _Serous_.

Of the _Caput Mortuum_ or meer _Earth_, it is observable, that it was
near ½ an Ounce or ¼ᵗʰ part of the whole; Which is almost Six times as
much as the _Caput Mortuum_ of _Common Dock_: and much more than that
of any other _Root_ I have yet calcin’d. Whereby it seemeth probable
that _Rhubarb_ looseth much of its _Volatile Part_, and therefore of
its _Virtue_, before it comes to our _Shops_.

_Sena_ (℔j) yields 4 Scruples and ½ of _Salt_; or the 85ᵗʰ part.

_Jalap_ (℔j) yields but one Drachm and 15 Grains, or 102ᵈ part.

_Colocynthis_ (℔j of the _Pulp_) yields an Ounce and half of _Caput
Mortuum_, which is almost all _Salt_. Yet allow half an Ounce of the
_Salt_, and _Earth_ to be wasted in filtring &c. the remaining Ounce is
no less than 1/16ᵗʰ part of the whole. Which is more than in any of the
above named _Plants_, except the _Sea-Scurvygrass_.

         _Of the QUANTITIES afforded by the_ Parts _of several_
                      Plants _distinctly calcin’d._


I SHALL next set down some _Tryals_, upon one _Part_ of a _Plant_, as
well _Organick_, as _Content_, separated from the rest; in answer to
these supposed _Queries_.

Quer. 1. _What Proportion doth the Lixivial Salt of the Pith or Pithy
Part of a Plant, bear to that of the Fibrous, or of the Woody Part?
Or whether is there a Fixed Salt always found in either of them?_ A
sufficient _Answer_ to which, must be built upon many _Tryals_. At
present I shall mention only Two; one upon _Starch_, answerable to the
_Pithy Parts_; the other upon _Flax_, consisting almost wholly of the
_Nervous_ or _Towy Fibers_: of the _Volatile parts ♦ §. 50, 51, 52. ♦_
whereof, chiefly, I have given some account in the foregoing _Idea_.

Of _Starch_, ℔j yieldeth about ℔¼ not of _Ashes_, but of _Black Coal_.
For though it be exposed in a _Calcining Furnace_ to a vehement _fire_,
for 5 or 6 hours, which is longer then will serve to calcine most
Bodies: yet would it not in the least part, be reduced to _Ashes_; but
to the last continued (though the fierceness of the _Fire_ consumed
part of it) as _black_, as when it was first burnt. So strangely
was the remaining part of the _Sulphur_ fixed to the _Earth_; that
in flying away, it did volatilize and carry that away with it. In
this _Coal_ or _Cinder_, there is not the least of a _Lixivial_ or
other _Taste_. And although, upon _Tryal_ I find, That the _Pith_ of
many _Plants_, as of a _Cabbage Stalk_, will yield some quantity of
_Lixivial Salt_; yet it is probably, that generally, it yields less
than the _Wood_.

Of _Flax_, ℔j yields not above 50 Grains of _Caput Mortuum_ or _white
Ashes_, which are _Salt_. According to vulgar conceit, it would seem
to be a very dry Body: yet of 153 parts, 152 are _volatile_, and being
distilled would have been collected into _Liquor_. Hence also appears
the great and unexpected _Variety_ in the _Proportion_ of the _Earthy
Parts_, as well as the other _Principles_ of _Bodies_. Or else, that
there are divers kinds of _Earths_, even in _Plants_, of which, as well
as of _Salts_ &c. some are _volatile_. For of ℔j of this _Plant_, there
remaineth fixed but 50 Grains: whereas of ℔j of _Rhubarb_, there will
remain near 1920 Grains, _i. e._ 88 times as much as the former.

Quer. 2. _In what proportion is the Lixivial Salt found in the Gumms of
Plants? and whether is it yielded, more or less, by all?_ For answer
to which, I caused the Eleven following, of each two Ounces, to be
calcin’d, and so observed,

That _Common Rosin_, yields but one Grain and ½ of _Caput Mortuum_. So
that ℔j will yield but 12 Grains. In this _Caput Mort._ there is not
the least particle of _Salt_, it being altogether insipid.

_Mastick_ yields gr. 12 of _Cap. Mort._ But not the least part of
_Salt_. Of this _Rosin_, it is observable; That being set, in a
_Crucible_, within the fire, before it comes to have thick fumes, it
boyls up with a very great foame or froath; and is the only _Gum_ or
_Rosin_ (of the Eleven) that hath this property. So that I suspect,
there is a great quantity of some kind of _volatile Spirit_, which then
flies away; and so, in breaking through the _Oyly parts_, huffs them up
to so great a froath.

_Olibanum_ yields half a Drachm of _Caput Mortuum_. But it is to be
noted, That the weight is encreased by certain little _Spar-Stones_,
which in the burning of several parcels, I always found mixed with this
_Gumm_. These being picked clean out, the _Cap. Mort._ weigheth not
much more than that of _Mastick_. And is in like manner insipid, when
the said _Stones_ are picked out.

From hence it appears, how proper these _Gums_ are for the _Concoction_
of _Salt Rheums_; ♦ _Discourse_ of _Mixture_ Cap. Ult. ♦ according to
what I have formerly suggested from another Experiment.

It may also be noted, that _Rosin_ and _Mastick_, seem to be more
purely _Acidoleous Gums_; not only from their consistence which is
uniform; and their _Smell_, which is less strong and more pleasant: but
also from the _Acid Liquor_ they yield by _Distillation_; and in that
the young _Leavs_ of _Fir_, and especially of _Pine_, are sower; and
’tis probable that those of _Mastick_ are so likewise. Whereby these,
and other like _Gums_ are more especially fitted for the abovesaid
purpose. But _Olibanum_ seems, besides its _Acidity_, to contein some
_Volatile Alkaly_, and so to be an _Acid-Alkaline Gum_. For as it
hath a stronger _Smell_ than the former, so a hotter _Taste_; both
the ordinary effects of an _Alkaline Sulphur_. And being infused in
several _Menstruums_, appears to consist of two Bodies, one of them
more _Resinous_ than the other. Of which, it is probable, that the one
is made by the _Acid parts_ as the other by the _Alkaline_. Whereby it
is very well adapted in some _Cases_, as in a _Pleuresie_, for removing
the _Coagulations_ of the _Blood_, or its disposition thereunto.

_Asa fœtida_ yields no less than half its weight or an Ounce of
_Caput Mort._ that is 8 times as much as that of the other _Gumms_,
and 48 times as much as that of some of them. Yet doth it not contein
one grain of _Salt_, so far as can be judged by its _Tast_. Yet the
_Strength_ and _Loathsomness_ of the _Smell_ and _Tast_ of the _Gumm_
do argue it to be highly impregnated with some kind of _Volatile
Alkaly_ proper to arrest those offensive _Vapours_ (to use the vulgar
word) which flying, either by the _Blood_ or _Nerves_, from part to
part, do often prove so troublesome.

_Gum Arabick_ yields one Scruple of _Cap. Mort._ whereof, by the
_Taste_, about ⅓ᵈ part is _Salt_.

_Euphorbium_ yields one _Drachm_ of _Caput Mort._ of which, by the
strength of the _Taste_, two Scruples seem to be _Salt_. Which confirms
a former conjecture[78] of its being an _Alkaline Gumm_.

     [78] Of the _Luctation_ of _Bodies_, _Ch. 1._

_Myrrh_ also yields a Drachm of _Cap. Mort._ and at least two Scruples
of _Salt_. Of the Eleven, these two _Gums_ have the greatest quantity
of a fixed _Alkaly_.

_Opium_ yields half a Drachm of _Cap. Mort._ whereof the one half is
_Salt_.

_Aloe_ yields a Drachm of _Cap. Mort._ conteining about one Scruple of
_Salt_.

_Scammony_ yields Two Scruples of _Cap. Mort._ of which, about half a
Scruple is _Salt_.

_Gutta Gamba_ yields but half a Scruple of _Cap. Mort._ of which four
or five Grains are _Salt_.

So that considering the _Dose_ of any _Cathartick Gumm_, the quantity
of the Fixed _Alkaly_, is extream small with respect to the _Volatile
parts_: In which, therefore, its _Cathartick Power_ doth chiefly reside.

Yet none of the _Cathartick Gumms_ are without some portion, more or
less, of a Fixed _Alkaly_; though some of the rest are. Which seemeth
to prove, That the Fixed it self, hath some Interest in the business of
_Purgation_: as by being a _Clog_ to the _Volatile_, and so preventing
its being deleterious; or some other way. But the manner of their
_Operation_ will better be understood, when the _Volatile Parts_ have
likewise been examined.

It may also be of good import, to know, what different quantities of
_Salt_, are afforded by the _Tartars_ of all sorts of _Wines_. Whereby,
partly, as well as by the quantity of the _Tartar_, we may be enabled
the better to judge of the _Nature_ of _Wines_.

             Read before the _Royal Society_, _December 21,

  _In which is shewed the way of making both an ESSENTIAL and a
     MARINE_ Salt, _out of the LIXIVIAL_ Salt _of a_ Plant.


SOMETIME since, I took the boldness to present my thoughts to this
Honourable and Learned Body in a _Discourse_ concerning _Mixture_.
Wherein I have endeavoured to lay such a _Foundation_, as might
hereafter reduce the _Doctrine_ hereof to _Experience_ and _Practice_;
and to demonstrate, the _Power_ and _Use_ of _Artificial Mixture_.
And in further proof of what is therein asserted, I have since made a
continuation of _Experiments_ upon the same Subject, in Two _Methods_.
One in the _Mixture_ of several _Menstruums_, both _Acid_ and
_Alkaline_, with all Sorts of _Bodies_. The Other, by calcining them,
or, as it were, _mixing_ them with the _Fire_.

2. §. I shall now proceed to a Third, which is, the _mixing_ them
with the _Aer_ or exposing them to it; another of Natures grand
_Menstruums_; which goes sometimes further than the _Fire_ it self,
in the dissolution of Bodies. This I have formerly mentioned for the
Imitation of _Nature_, in producing a _Marine_ or _Muriatick Salt_
out of the _Lixivial Salt_ of a _Plant_. ♦ _Discourse_ of _Mixture_
Ch. 5. Inst. 2. ♦ But some Learned Persons then present, seeming to
doubt of the Experiment; I thought it requisite to prosecute the same
a little further; that so, if possible, it might become clear and
unquestionable. And because that _Method_ was imperfect, and required
half a year, or a longer time: I bethought my self of an other way;
which proved far better, and more expedite. And which, withall,
afforded me, not only a true _Marine Salt_, out of the _Lixivial
Salt_ of a _Plant_; but also another kind of _Salt_, different from
them both: which may not be improperly called, an _Essential Salt_ or
_Nitre_ of _Plants_. The History or manner of the production of them
both, is as follows.

3. §. _December 15. 1675_, I took about half a pound of a strong
_Solution_ of the _Lixivial Salt_ of _Firne_: and pouring it into an
_Earthen Pan_, well glazed, broad and shallow, exposed it therein to
the open _Aer_, in a Chamber Window, to evaporate of it self. ♦ _Tab.
83._ ♦

4. §. This _Solution_ or _Lee_, although it was very clear before, and
having stood corked up in a bottle many days, had no sedement: yet
standing now in the open _Aer_, within the space of 4 or 5 days, it
began to let fall a very _white Sedement_, like fine _Chalk_; which
encreased daily for 8 or 10 days; amounting at last to about half a
Drachm of white, light and meer _Earth_, altogether insipid, and when
it was well washed, stirring not upon the _Affusion_ of _Acids_.

5. §. Within the space of a day or two after this _white Sedement_
began to fall to the bottom; there was also gathered on the top, a kind
of soft _Scum_ or _Cremor_, wherewith the _Solution_ was covered all
over.

6. §. Within 8 or 9 days after the first exposing of the _Liquor_, or
2 or 3 days after the gathering of the _Cremor_; that _Salt_, which I
take leave to call, an _Essential Salt_ of _Plants_, began to appear;
shooting into several little _Crystals_. These _Crystals_, as they grew
bigger, began to sink, and at last fell down to the bottom of the _Pan_.

7. §. Upon their first generation or shooting, the said _Cremor_
presently breaks, leaving a bare space round about each _Crystal_; and
upon the bounds of every space is indented; ♦ _Tab. 83._ ♦ the space
growing bigger and bigger together with the _Crystal_ in the Centre.
And so, by that time the _Crystals_ are grown to a considerable number
and bigness, the _Cremor_ vanishes away, the several _Circles_ or bare
places breaking at last one into another all over the _Surface_ of the
_Lee_. After which, it never comes again.

8. §. From whence it seemeth, That the several _Circles_ or bare
_Spaces_ about the _Crystals_, are made for the more free admission
of the _Aer_, requisite to their _Generation_. For as there is no
_Crystal_ begins to be formed before there is a breach made in the
_Cremor_: so that breach is enlarged together with the _Crystal_.
So that as the falling of the _Sedement_ and the gathering of the
_Cremor_, sheweth that the _Aer_, as a _Menstruum_ separates some part
from the _Lee_: so the breaking of the _Cremor_ afterwards, that as a
_Vehicle_, it brings something to it: both in order to the _Generation_
of the _Crystals_. _Nature_ taking a _Method_ for the _Generation_
of simpler Bodies, as well as of those which are _Compounded_ and
_Organical_.

9. §. The _Figure_ of these _Crystals_ is angular and oblong, most of
them about the fifth, sixth or seventh of an Inch; but none of them
very regular. Yet we are not hence to conclude, but that with the help
of some Circumstances which might be wanting in the shooting of these;
some portion of regular ones may be obteined from this, as well as
other _Lixivial Salts_ hereafter mentioned.

10. §. They are somewhat transparent, and of a dark _Ambar Color_, or
like that of brown _Sugar-Candy_. Of a quite different _Taste_ from
that of the _Solution_ or _Lee_ out of which they are bred; being not
at all _Lixivial_, but very weak and mild; not _Salt_, but _Bitter_ in
a good degree.

11. §. It is also observable, that _Alkaline_ and _Acid Salts_ being
both poured severally upon these _Crystals_, they stir not, nor are
any way affected with either of them. So that these _Crystals_ are no
sort of _Tartar_, or _Tartareous Salt_. As is plain, from the manner
of their _Generation_; _Tartar_ being still bred in close _Vessels_;
these never, but by exposing the _Liquor_ to the _Aer_. As also from
their _Taste_, being not sower, in the least, but bitter. And in that
_Tartar_ will make a _Bullition_ with _Alkaline Salts_, which these
will not do. Upon which accounts it appears, that they are a _Salt_
different in Nature from all other _Salts_ hitherto known, or a new
_Species_ added to the _Inventory_ of _Nature_.

12. §. These _Crystals_ within the space of about a fortnight after
their first _Generation_, did also cease to shoot any more, but only
increased a little in their _Bulk_. After which time, I dayly expected
to see the production also of a true _Marine Salt_. And about two
months after the said _Essential Crystals_ had done shooting, and not
before, this also began to shoot, in many small _Crystals_, and at the
top of the _Solution_, as the other did, still falling to the bottom as
they grew biger.

13. §. The _Size_ of most of them was near that of the _Flakes_ or
_Grains_ of _Bay-Salt_. The _Colour_ of some of them _white_, of others
_transparent_; and of others _white_ in the _Centre_, with transparent
_Edges_; as is also usual in the _Crystals_ of _Common Salt_.

14. §. The _Figure_ of most is a perfect _Square_, and of very many
coming near to a _Cube_; which is also the _Figure_ of _Common Salt_,
and seldome an exact _Cube_. An exact _Cube_, being the constant
property of no _Marine Salt_, that I know of, except that of the
_Dead Sea_. ♦ _Tab. 83._ ♦ Divers of them were also raised as it were
by several steps from a deep Centre to the Top: as is often seen in
the common shooting of _Common Salt_; and not in any other. Their
_Taste_ is neither _Lixivial_, as that of the _Solution_ out of which
they shoot; nor bitterish, as that of the _Essential Crystals_; nor
sowerish, as that of _Tartar_; but the perfect _Taste_ of _Common Salt_.

15. §. It is also to be noted, That if _Oyl_ of _Vitriol_, and some
other strong _Acids_, be poured upon this artificial _Sea-Salt_, they
make an _Effervescence_ together: but if _Spirit_ of _Salt_ or _Spirit_
of _Nitre_ either be poured on it, though it be never so strong it
stirreth it not. In both which, and all the formentioned respects, it
answers to the _Properties_ of a _Marine_ or _Common Salt_, which no
other _Salt_ doth. I conclude it therefore to be a true _Marine Salt_
produced by _Art_ in the imitation of _Nature_.




                                CHAP. II.

  _Wherein is shewed, That the said ESSENTIAL and MARINE_ Salts _of_
     Plants _are both of different Sorts._


HAVING made the Experiment, that both an _Essential_ and _Marine Salt_
may be produced out of the _Lixivial Salt_ of a _Plant_. I thought it
probable, that neither the one nor the other, was always the same, but
that as they had their general properties which made them to be of
two general kinds; so they might have some special property, for the
distinguishing of each kind into several Sorts. And withall, that in a
warmer season, than before taken, the _Tryal_ hereof might be finished
in a shorter time.

2. §. For the making of which, I conceived it requisite to remove an
Opinion which seemed to lye in my way; _sc._ That there is little or no
difference between the several _Lixivial Salts_ of _Plants_, as some
Learned men have thought. But either there is a difference, or not: if
not, it should be proved: and if there be, it should then be justly
stated, what that difference is. For the doing of which, I chose this
_Method_. I took an equal quantity of the whitest and purest _Salts_
of divers _Plants_, all made by an equal degree of _Calcination_;
and dissolved them all severally in an equal quantity of water. And
pouring likewise an equal quantity, as about 10 or 12 drops of each
into a spoon, I tasted them severally. Whereby it was very evident,
that they were not all of one _Tast_, but of very different ones, both
as to strength and kind: and therefore different in Nature also. The
_Salts_ I made tryal of were those of _Sorrel_, _Anise_, _Wormwood_,
_Mallow_, _Ash_, _Tartar_ and others: and upon half a Drachm of each I
poured ℥ijß of water. The _Solutions_ are here present to be tasted. By
which the differences will easily be observed, and particularly that
the _Salt_ of _Wormwood_ or _Scurvygrass_, is almost as strong again
as the _Salt_ of _Anise_, or _Sorrel_: and that the _Salt_ of _Ash_ is
above twice as strong, and that of _Tartar_ above thrice as strong, as
that of _Sorrel_, and almost thrice as strong as that of _Wormwood_ or
_Scurvygrass_. So that he who shall give half a Scruple, suppose of
_Salt_ of _Tartar_; instead of half a Scruple of _Salt_ of _Wormwood_,
or other like _Salt_; he may as well give a Scruple of _Rosin_ of
_Jalap_, for a Scruple of the powder, or almost three Drachms of
_Rhubarb_, or other like _Purge_, instead of one. And the like is to be
said of other _Lixivial Salts_ in their degrees.

3. §. Having observed thus much, I proceeded to repeat the former
Experiment, with some of the aforesaid, and some other _Vegetable
Salts_, the best calcin’d, and the purest, that could be made for
this purpose, being these Six _Salts_, _sc._ of _Rosemary_, _Garden
Scurvygrass_, _Black Thorn_, _Common Wormwood_, _Ash_, and _Tartar_.
All which dissolved severally in fair water, I exposed in a Chamber
window, and not in Winter, as before, but in the heat of Summer, _sc._
on the 19 of _July_, to evaporate of themselves.

4. §. The Effect was, That the third day after their being exposed, the
_Essential Crystals_ began to shoot in three of the _Solutions_, _sc._
in that of _Rosemary_, of _Garden Scurvygrass_, and of _Black Thorn_.
On the fourth day, in that of _Wormwood_. On the fifth day, in that of
_Ash_. In that of _Tartar_, not at all.

5. §. These _Essential Crystals_ began, in all, to shoot at the top,
and then to fall to the bottome; as in the Experiment before. But
as there was very little of the _white Sedement_ before mentioned,
that preceded; So no _Scum_ or _Cremor_ at all. Which although a more
perfect _Calcination_, it seems, did here almost prevent; yet did not
in the least destroy the aforesaid _Essential Salt_, but rather make
way for its more speedy and copious _Production_: exhibiting likewise a
distinct _Species_ in several of the _Solutions_.

6. §. For first, the _Crystals_ of _Rosemary_ (the largest of them)
were about the bigness of a _Rice-Corn_. In _Figure_ almost like a
_Tip-Cat_, which Boys play with, split down the midle. Each _Tip_ being
cut into 5 sides all ending in a poynt: ♦ _Tab. 83._ ♦ the midle part
divided into 7, all drawn by parallel _Lines_; the topmost with the
lowermost but one, on each side, being three exact _Squares_.

7. §. The _Crystals_ of _Black Thorn_ are most of them poynted with
just six sides of Equal _Measure_: very like to the shooting of true
_Crystal_ it self. ♦ _Tab. 83._ ♦ From the topmost of which six Sides,
a _Line_ being drawn out, runs parallel to a broad _Base_, whereon each
_Crystal_ stands. So that they are in some sort of a _Rhomboid Figure_.

8. §. The _Crystals_ of _Scurvygrass_ have also a very elegant and
regular _Figure_, which is in a manner compounded of the two former
now described. But they are nothing near so bigg, the largest of them,
being no biger than a _Grain_ of that which we call _Pearl Barley_.

9. §. The _Crystals_ of _Wormwood_ have also very many of them a
regular _Figure_; but quite different from that of the _Crystals_
before mentioned; each _Crystal_ being a little _Cylinder_, saving
that it is constantly somewhat smaller at one end, than the other: as
it were one half of a _Rowling-pin_. ♦ _Tab. 83._ ♦ And not evenly
_Circular_, but cut out by Six _Sides_ of equal _Measure_: almost as
in the _Crystal_ of _Nitre_. So that contrary to what is seen in the
forementioned _Crystals_, the ends of these of _Wormwood_ are not
poynted, but _flat_; and cut at _Right Angles_ with the _Sides_.

10. §. The _Crystals_ of _Ash_, though by their properties they appear
likewise to be _Essential_; yet are nothing near so regularly figur’d,
as all the forementioned.

11. §. The _Colour_ also of the said _Crystals_ is somewhat different:
Those of _Ash_ being of a _brown_ transparency, almost like those of
_Firne_. Those of _Wormwood_ being also _brownish_, but _paler_. Those
of _Rosemary_ and _Scurvygrass_ having some little _Tincture_, yet very
_clear_. But those of _Black Thorn_ without the least _Tincture_, and
as _clear_ as _Crystal_ it self.

12. §. None of these _Essential Crystals_ have any hot fiery _Taste_,
but are very _mild_, and sensibly _Bitter_; especially, about the
_Root_ of the _Tongue_: as is also observable of some _Plants_
hereafter mentioned, in speaking of the different _Tastes_ of _Plants_.

13. §. _Oyl_ of _Vitriol_ droped upon these _Crystals_ doth not
affect them in the least: yet droped into the several _Solutions_ out
of which the _Crystals_ are produced, immediately causeth a great
_Effervescence_.

14. §. Of the _Solutions_ above named, that, of _Salt_ of _Tartar_ was
the 6ᵗʰ. Whereof it is remarquable, That having waited several Months
together, I could not observe the least _Essential Salt_ to be therein
produced in all that time. Whether there be any other _Vegetable
Salts_, besides this of _Tartar_, which will not yield the _Essential_
above described, I have not yet experimented.

15. §. In the mean time, from the _Premises_ it is very probable, that
most of them afford more or fewer of the said _Crystals_. In regard
they are _Plants_ of a very different kind, which I made tryal upon:
as _Garden Scurvygrass_, very _Hot_; _Rosemary_, very _Aromatick_.
_Wormwood_ very _Bitter_; _Black Thorn_, _Astringent_ and _Sower_. And
it is also plain, That the said _Essential Salts_ contained in the
_Lixivial_, are not altogether one and the same, but of divers Sorts.


16. §. ABOUT 7 or 8 days after the _Essential Crystals_ were produced;
the _Marine Salt_ did also begin to shoot; first in _Rosemary_; quickly
after, in _Scurvygrass_; Next, in _Black Thorn_ and _Wormwood_, _sc._
after the space of a week or 10 days more. And in all of them with some
difference of _Size_ and _Figure_.

17. §. The plainest of all, was that produced out of the _Salt_ of
_Black Thorn_, consisting for the most part of very small _Crystals_,
not above the 15ᵗʰ of an Inch square, as also _thin_, shaped like a
_Duch Tile_ used for _Chimnies_. Many others were very _thick_, and
near to a _Cube_. ♦ _Tab. 83._ ♦ Most of which were a little hollowed
in the midle, like a grinding _Marble_ or _Salt-Celler_; and the hollow
bounded by 4 plain and equal _Sides_, all descending a little towards
the _Centre_; and measured by two cross _Lines_, which staid upon the
four _Angles_ of the _Square_, and so cut one the other at _Right
Angles_. Both which _Properties_ are likewise usually seen in the
_Crystals_ of _Common Salt_.

18. §. In _Wormwood_, many of these _Crystals_, besides the plain ones,
were figur’d crossways like a _Dagger-Hilt_. ♦ _Tab. 83._ ♦ Which was
sometimes naked, and sometimes inclosed in a square and almost _Cubical
Box_. Many others were figur’d into _Sprigs_ made up of four chief
_Branches_ standing crosswise, and those _subbranched_; and all the
_Branches_ made up of little square _Crystals_, clustered together
in that _Figure_. The _Sprigy Figure_ of these _Crystals_ is not
accidental, but hath constantly come after they had been three times
dissolved, and the _Solution_ exposed to evaporate.

19. §. The _Marine Salt_ of _Rosemary_ hath also some variety. For
besides the plain ones above described, there are some thick _Squares_,
♦ _Tab. 83._ ♦ which have also a square hollow descending by five, six,
or seven narrow steps, towards the _Centre_; being in _Figure_, saving
these _Steps_, somewhat like the _Hoper_ in a _Mill_.

20. §. Upon a second _Solution_ of the same _Salt_, there shoots
another sort of square; which is not plain on the edges, as the
above-named, ♦ _Tab. 83._ ♦ but scalloped or florid all round about,
not unlike the _Leaves_ of some _Plants_.

21. §. The _Crystals_ of _Marine Salt_ of _Scurvygrass_ are somewhat
like to those of _Rosemary_ now described.

22. §. As for the _Lixivial Salts_ of _Ash_ and _Tartar_, though
in a Month or Five Weeks Space, they yield some _Crystals_ of very
clear _Salt_: yet of _Marine Salt_ neither of them yieldeth the least
particle. So that of these Six _Lixivial Salts_, _sc._ of _Rosemary_,
_Scurvygrass_, _Black Thorn_, _Wormwood_, _Ash_ and _Tartar_, all, but
that of _Tartar_, yielded an _Essential Salt_. And all, but those of
_Ash_ and _Tartar_, yielded a _Marine_, such as is above described.
All which _Salts_ both _Essential_ and _Marine_, together with their
_Models_, made of _white Alabastre_, I have here ready to be seen.

23. §. Of those that yield these _Salts_, or either of them, it is
further to be noted, That there is a considerable difference in
the _Proportion_ or _Quantities_ which they yield. The _Rosemary_
yields store both of _Essential_ and _Marine_, but more _Essential_.
_Wormwood_ and _Scurvygrass_ more _Marine_. _Black Thorn_ less of
Either. The _Ash_ no _Marine_, and the _Tartar_ neither the _Essential_
nor _Marine_, as hath been said.

24. §. From what hath been said, I deduce only at present these Three
_Corollaies_. _First_, That a _Lixivial Salt_, is not only a compounded
Body _sc._ of _Salt_, _Sulphur_, _Aer_ and _Earth_; but even a
_Compounded Salt_, containing both a _Vegetable Nitre_, and a true _Sea
Salt_.

25. §. _Secondly_, That the _Exposing_ of _Bodies_, in the manner above
shewed, may justly be accounted one _Part_ of _Chymistry_ hitherto
_Deficient_, and much farther to be improved for the _Discovery_ of the
_Nature_ of _Bodies_. For as _Nature_ chiefly compoundeth _Bodies_ by
_Digesting_ them, and so either shutting out or keeping in the _Aer_:
So she _Dissolveth_ them by _Exposing_, and so neither shutting in
the _Aer_, nor keeping it out, but leaving it free to come and go;
and thereby to bring, and carry off whatsoever is necessary for the
_Separation_ or _Solution_ of _Bodies_. For the _Sea_ it self (to
confine the similitude to our present case) is but as a _Great Pan_,
wherein all kinds of bodies being long exposed, are throughly resolved,
ultimately yielding from the rest of their _visible Principles_, that
which we call _Sea Salt_.

26. §. _Lastly_, if by _Exposing_ and _Dissolving_ we can make one
_Salt_; then by _Compounding_ and _Digesting_ we may make another, yea
any other _Salt_; either a _Fixed_ of a _Volatile_, or a _Volatile_
of a _Fixed_. That is to say, a _Volatile Salt_ may be so separated
from other _Bodies_, as to become _Fixed_; or a _Fixed Salt_ may be
so _mixed_ with other _Bodies_ as to become _Volatile_. For that any
_Salt_ should of it self become _Fixed_ or _Volatile_, is a _Fixion_
not grounded upon _Experiment_.

27. §. As for the _Virtue_ of the _Essential Salts_ above described, I
believe they will be found upon tryal, not contemptible in some Cases.
For which amongst other reasons, I have been the more punctual in
relating the manner of their _Generation_; that others also may have
the opportunity of making proof hereof.

28. §. When I made the _Experiments_ for this and the foregoing
_Discourse_, not having so good conveniency at home for making the
_Salts_ I used: I procured them all (except that of _Firne_, which
I made my self) to be purposely prepared by Mr. _John Blackstone_ a
_London Apothecary_, who assured me of his great care herein; and
particularly, that he added no _Nitre_ to whiten any of the _Salts_
with, as is commonly done for that of _Tartar_.

               I do declare, That all the _Lixivial Salts_ mentioned
               in this and the foregoing _Discourse_ except that of
               _Firne_, were faithfully prepared by me

                                                      _John Blackstone._

                                Estate._


HAVING formerly made some _Observations_ of the _Colours_ of _Plants_;
♦ _Idea, §. 27._ and _Anat._ of _R. P. 2. §. 65,_ &c. ♦ I shall now
crave leave to add some more to them of the like _Nature_. None of
which, nor any of the _Conclusions_ thence deduced, will, if duly
considered, appear contrary to the _Hypothesis_ and _Experiments_ of
Mr. _Boyle_, Mr. _Des Cartes_, Mr. _Hook_, Mr. _Newton_, or any other,
concerning _Colours_. As not having respect to the _Colours_ of all
_Bodies_ in general. Nor to the _Body_ of _Colour_, which is _Light_;
Nor to the formal notion of _Colours_ (_ad extra_) as the _Rays_
of _Light_ are moved or mixed: But to those _Materials_, which are
principally necessary to their _Production_ in _Plants_. Concerning
which, the present _Discourse_ shall be reduced to these Three general
_Heads_, _scil._

2. §. _First_, Of those several _Colours_, which appear in _Plants_ in
their _Natural Estate_.

3. §. _Secondly_, As they appear upon the _Infusion_ of _Plants_ into
several Sorts of _Liquors_.

4. §. _Thirdly_, As upon the _Mixture_ of those _Infusions_, or of any
one of them with some other _Liquor_, or other _Body_.

5. §. As they appear in the _Plants_ themselves, it may be observed in
the first place, That there is a far less variety in the _Colours_ of
_Roots_, than of the other _Parts_: the _Parenchyma_ being, within the
_Skin_, usually _White_, sometimes _Yellow_, rarely _Red_. The _Cause_
hereof being, for that they are kept, by the _Earth_, from a free and
open _Aer_; which concurreth with the _Juyces_ of the several _Parts_,
to the _Production_ of their several _Colours_. And therefore the upper
parts of _Roots_, when they happen to stand naked above the Ground,
are often deyed with several _Colours_: so the tops of _Sorrel Roots_
will turn _Red_, those of _Mullen_, _Turneps_ and _Radishes_, will turn
_purple_, and many others _green_. Whereas those parts of the same
_Roots_ which lie more under Ground, are commonly _White_.

6. §. As _Roots_ are more commonly _White_; so the _Leaves_, _Green_.
Which _Colour_ is so proper to them, that many _Leaves_, as those of
_Sage_, the young _Sprouts_ of St. _Johns-wort_, and others, which are
_Redish_ when in the _Bud_; upon their full _Growth_, acquire a perfect
_Green_.

7. §. The _Cause_ of this _Colour_, is the _action_ of the _Aer_, both
from within, and from without the _Plant_, upon the _Juyces_ thereof,
whereby it strikes them into that _Colour_.

8. §. By the _Aer_ from without, I mean that which surrounds the _Body_
of the _Plant_: which is the Cause of its _Greeness_, not meerly as it
is contiguous to it, but as it penetrates through the _Pores_ of the
_Skin_, thereinto; and so mixing with the _Juyces_ thereof, plainly
deys or strikes them into a _Green_.

9. §. By the _Aer_ from within, I mean, that which entring, together
with the _Aliment_, at the _Root_, thence ascends by the _Aer-Vessels_,
into the _Trunk_ and _Leaves_, and is there transfused into all the
several _Juyces_, thereby likewise concurring to their _Verdure_.
Whence it is, that the _Parts_ of _Plants_ which lie under _Water_, are
_Green_, as well as those which stand above it; because, though the
ambient _Aer_, conteined in the _Water_ be but little, yet the want of
it is compensated, by that which ascends from the _Root_.

10. §. And therefore it is observable, that the _Stalks_ of
_Marsh-Mallow_, and some other _Plants_, being cut transversly, though
the _Parenchyma_ in the _Barque_ be _white_, yet the _Sap-Vessels_
which lie within that _Parenchyma_, are as _Green_ as the _Skin_ it
self; _scil._ because they stand close to the _Aer-Vessels_. The
_Parenchyma_, I say, which is intercepted from the _Aer_, without,
by the _Skin_; and from the _Aer_ within, by the _Sap Vessels_, is
_white_: but the _Skin_, which is exposed to the _Aer_ without, and
the _Sap-Vessels_ which are next neighbours to that within, are both
equally _Green_. So likewise if a _Carrot_ be plucked up, and suffered
to lie sometime in the open _Aer_; that part which standeth in and near
the _Centre_, amongst the _Aer-Vessels_, will become _Green_ as well
as the _Skin_, all the other _Parts_ continuing of a _Redish Yellow_,
as before. The _Aer_ therefore, both from without, and from within
the _Plant_, together with the _Juyces_ of the _Plant_, are all the
concurrent _Causes_ of its _Verdure_.


11. §. BUT how doth the _Aer_ concur to the _Greeness_ of _Plants_? I
answer; Not as it is meerly either _cold_ or _dry_, or _moist_, nor
yet _quatenus Aer_; but as it is a mixed, and particularly, a _Saline
Body_: that is, as there is a considerable quantity of _Saline Parts_
mixed with those which are properly _Aereal_. It being plain from
manifold Experience; That the several kinds of _Salts_, are the grand
_Agents_ in the _Variation_ of _Colours_. So that, to speak strictly,
although _Sulphur_ be indeed the _Female_, or _Materia substrata_, of
all _Colours_; yet _Salt_ is the _Male_ or _Prime Agent_, by which the
_Sulphur_ is determined to the _Production_ of one _Colour_, and not of
another.

12. §. If then it be the _Aer_ mixed with the _Juyces_ of a _Plant_,
and the _Salt_ of the _Aer_, that makes it _Green_; It may further be
asked, what kind of _Salt_? But this is more hard to judge of. Yet it
seemeth, that it is not an _Acid_, but a _Subalkaline Salt_; or at
least some _Salt_ which is different from a simple _Acid_, and hath an
_Affinity_ with _Alkalies_.

13. §. One reason why I so judge, is, Because that although all
_Plants_ yield an _Alkaly_, or other _Salt_ different from an _Acid_,
and some in good quantity; yet in most _Plants_, the _Prædominant
Principle_ is an _Acid_. So that the _Supply_ of an _Acid Principle_
from the _Aer_, for the _Production_ of a _Green Colour_, as it would
be superfluous; So also ineffectual: a different _Principle_ being
requisite to the striking of this, together with the _Sulphur_, into a
_Green Colour_.

14. §. I suppose therefore, That not only _Green_, but all the
_Colours_ of _Plants_, are a kind of _Precipitate_, resulting from
the concurrence of the _Saline Parts_ of the _Aer_, with the _Saline_
and _Sulphurious Parts_ of the _Plant_; and that the _Subalkaline_,
or other like _Saline Part_ of the _Aer_, is concurrent with the
_Acid_ and _Sulphurious Parts_ of _Plants_, for the _Production_
of their _Verdure_; that is, as they strike altogether into a
_Green Precipitate_. Which also seemeth to be confirmed by divers
_Experiments_ hereafter mentioned.


15. §. THE _Colours_ of _Flowers_ are various; differing therein not
only from the _Leaf_, but one from another. Yet all seem to depend
upon the general _Causes_ aforesaid. And therefore the _Colours_ of
_Flowers_, as well as of _Leaves_, to result not solely from the
_Contents_ of the _Plant_, but from the concurrence likewise of the
_ambient Aer_. Hence it is, that as they gradually open, and are
exposed to the _Aer_, they still either acquire, or change their
_Colour_: no _Flower_ having its proper _Colour_ in the _Bud_, (though
it be then perfectly formed) but only when it is expanded. So the
_Purple Flower_ of _Stock-July Flowers_, while they are in the _Bud_,
are _white_, or _pale_. So _Batchelors Buttons_, _Blew Bottle_,
_Poppy_, _Red Daisies_, and many others, though of divers _Colours_
when blown, yet are all _white_ in the _Bud_. And many _Flowers_ do
thus change their _Colours_ thrice successively; as the youngest _Buds_
of _Ladys-Lookinglass_, _Bugloss_ and the like, are all white, the
larger _Buds_ are _purple_ or _murrey_, and the open _Flowers_, _blew_:
according as they come still neerer, and are longer exposed, to the
_Aer_.

16. §. But if the _Colour_ of the _Flower_ dependeth on the _ambient
Aer_; it may be asked: How it comes to pass then, that this _Colour_ is
various, and not one, and that one, a _Green_? that is to say that all
_Flowers_ are not _Green_, as well as the _Leaves_? In answer to this
Three things are to be premised.

17. §. _First_, What was said before, is to be remembred, that here
the _Aer_ is not a solitary, but concurrent _Cause_. So that besides
the _Efficacy_ of this, we are to consider that of the several parts
of the _Plant_, by which the _Contents_ both _Aereal_ and _Liquid_ are
supplied to the _Flower_.

18. §. _Secondly_, That in the _Lymphæducts_ of a _Plant_, _Sulphur_ is
the _predominant Principle_, and much more abounding than in any other
_part_ of a _Plant_, as also hath been formerly shewed.

19. §. _Thirdly_, That it appears, according to what we have observed
in the _Anatomy_ of the _Flower_, That the quantity of _Lymphæducts_
with respect to the _Aer-Vessels_ is greater in the _Flower_ than in
the _Leaf_.

20. §. It seemeth therefore, that the _Aer-Vessels_, and therefore the
_Aer_, being _predominant_ in the _Leaf_; _Green_, is therein also the
_predominant Colour_. I say _predominant_, because there are other
_Colours_ lye vailed under the _Green_, even in the _Leafe_, as will
hereafter appear more manifest.

21. §. On the contrary, the _Lymphæducts_, and therefore the _Sulphur_,
being more, and the _Aer-Vessels_ and therefore the _Aer_, less, in
the _Flower_ than in the _Leaf_; the _ambient Aer_ alone is not able
to controle the _Sulphur_ so far, but that it generally carrys the
greatest port in the _Production_ of the _Colour_. Yet in different
degrees; For if the proportion betwixt the _Lymphæducts_ and the
_Aer-Vessels_ be more equal, the _Flower_ is either _White_ or else
_Yellow_, which latter _Colour_ is the next of kin to a _Green_. If the
_Sulphur_ be somewhat _predominant_, the _Flower_ will shew it self
_Red_ at first; but the _ambient Aer_ hath so much power upon it, as
gradually to turn the _Red_ into a _Blew_. But if the _Sulphur_ be much
_predominant_, then the _Acid_ of the _ambient Aer_ will heighten it to
a fixed _Red_.

22. §. Hence it is, that _Yellows_ and _Greens_ are less alterable,
upon the drying of _Plants_ than other _Colours_; _sc._ Because the
_Aer_ being _predominant_ in their _Production_, they are the less
lyable to suffer from it afterwards. Whereas _Reds_ and _Purples_,
in the _Production_ whereof _Sulphur_ is _predominant_, are very
changeable. So the _Red_ Flowers of _Lysimachia_, upon drying, turn
_Purple_, and the young _purple Flowers_ of _Bugloss_ turn _Blew_.
So likewise the _Purple_ of _Bilberries_, and the _Crimson_ of baked
_Damascens_, both turn _Blew_. For being gathered, and so wanting a
continued supply of fresh _Sulphur_, to bear up the _Colour_ against
the force of the _Aer_; it strikes it down at last from _Red_ to
_Purple_ or _Blew_. I conclude therefore, that one _Principal Cause_ of
the _Variety_ of _Colours_ in the _Flower_, is the over proportion of
the _Lympheducts_ to the _Aer-Vessels_, and therefore the dominion of
the _Sulphur_ over the _Aer_, therein.

23. §. If it be objected, that the _Aer_ doth not deepen, but highten
the _Colour_ of the _Blood_: I answer, _First_, That I am not now
speaking of _Animal_, but of _Vegetable Bodies_; the same _Aer_
which hightens the _Colour_ of _Blood_ one way, may deepen that of a
_Flower_, another: nay and may highten that of some _Flowers_ too, some
other way.

24. §. And therefore, _Secondly_, it is to be considered, That as there
is not one only, but divers _Saline Principles_ in the _Aer_; so are
there also in the several _Parts_ of one _Plant_; as in the _Root_, of
one sort; in the _Leavs_, of another; in the _Flower_, of another; and
so in the other _Parts_. For since the _Figuration_ of the _Parts_ of
a _Plant_ dependeth chiefly upon the _Saline Principles_: and that
the _Flower_ hath a different _Figure_ from that of the _Leaf_: it
follows, that there is some _Saline Principle_ in the one, which is
not in the other, especially, all in such _Flowers_, whose _Figures_
are cut out by a greater _Variety_ and _Complication_ of _Lines_. The
_Leavs_ therefore, though variously shaped, yet agreeing so far in one
common _Figure_, as usualy to be _flat_; it therefore seemeth plain,
that there is a _Saline Principle_ in them all, so far _one_, as to be
the chief _Cause_ of that common _Figure_: and in concurrence with the
_ambient Aer_, to be likewise the chief _Cause_ of one common _Colour_,
_sc._ a _Green_.

25. §. Whereas the _Figure_ of the _Flowers_, and therefore their
_Saline Principle_, being more various, and commonly distinct from
that of the _Leaf_; it will easily concur with as a great _Variety_ of
_Salts_ in the _Aer_, whether _Acid_, _Alkaline_, _Nitrous_, _Urinous_,
_Armoniacal_, or any other therein existent, to the _Precipitation_ of
the _Sulphur_ into the like _Variety_ of _Colours_. Thus far of the
_Colours_ of _Plants_ as they appear in their _Natural Estate_.




                                CHAP. II.

                _Of the COLOURS of_ Plants _by_ Infusion.


THE next general _Inquiry_, proposed to be made, was this, After what
manner the _Colours_ of _Plants_ shew themselves, upon their _infusion_
into _Liquors_. The _Liquors_ I made use of for this purpose, were
three, _sc._ _Oyl_ of _Olives_, _Water_, and _Spirit_ of _Wine_. The
_Water_ I used was from the _Thames_, because I could not procure any
clear _Rain Water_, and had not leasure at present to distill any. But
next to this, that yields as little _Salt_, as any.

2. §. As for _Oyl_, it is known, that most _Plants_ either by _Coction_
or long _Infusion_, will give it their _Green Colour_. I have likewise
tryed some _Yellows_, and find they will do indifferently well; as
_Saffron_, which, by _Infusion_ in _Oyl_, gives it a light golden
_Tincture_.

3. §. Divers _Aromatick Plants_, as _Mint_, _Majorane_, &c. being dryed
and infused in _Oyl_ give it a double _Tincture_, both _green_ and
_yellow_; one drop of the _Oyl_ shewing _green_; but a good quantity of
it held up against a candle looketh _redish_ or of a deep _yellow_.

4. §. But there is no _Vegetable_ yet known which gives a true _Red_ to
_Oyl_, except _Alkanet Root_: with which, some colouring either common
or other _Oyl_, vend it under the name of the _Red Oyl_ of _Scorpions_.

5. §. These things confirm what we have said concerning the _Causes_ of
_Colours_ in the _Leavs_ and _Flowers_ of _Plants_, upon this twofold
Consideration. ♦ _Discourse_ of _Mixture_ Ch. 5. Inst. 2. §. 3. & Inst.
5. ♦ _First_, that _Oyl_ is the most proper _Menstruum_ of _Sulphur_.
_Secondly_, that _Oyls_ have a greater congruity with _Acids_ than with
_Alkalies_; as I have formerly shewed.

6. §. I say therefore, that in _Blews_, _Purples_ and especially
_Reds_, the _predominant Principles_ being _Sulphur_ and _Acid_, the
_Oyl_ either abstracts the _Sulphur_ of it self, or at least, unlocks
it from the _Acid Parts_; whereby both of them are bestowed seperately
to their like parts in the _Oyl_; upon which their disunion the
_Colour_ vanishes: that depending, not upon either of them alone, which
of themselves are _Colourless_, but upon both united together.

7. §. On the contrary, a _Green Colour_ not depending on a _predominant
Acid_, but an _Alkaly_, or some _Saline Principle_ different from
an _Acid_; this will not so easiely be imbibed separately, into the
_Pores_ of the _Oyl_, but only by mediation of their _Sulphur_. So that
being both imbibed without any disunion, they still retein the same
_green Colour_ they had before in the _Plant_.

8. §. Hence also it is, that _red Roses_ being dryed and infused some
time in _Oyl_ of _Anise Seeds_, a more potent _Menstruum_ than _Common
Oyl_; they wholly lose their own _Colour_, and turn _white_; the _Oyl_
remaining _Limpid_, as at the first. That is the _Sulphur_ or that part
of it on which cheifly the _Red_ depended, is absorbed separately by
the _Oyl_, and so the _Colour_ vanishes.


9. §. A SECOND _Menstruum_ I made use of, was _Water_. And _First_,
_Alkanet Root_, which immediately tinctures _Oyl_ with a deeper _Red_,
will not colour _Water_ in the least.

10. §. Next it is observable, That _Water_ will take all the _Colours_
of _Plants_ in _Infusion_ except a _Green_. So that as no _Plant_ will
by _Infusion_ give a perfect _Blew_ to _Oyl_; so their is none, that I
know of, which, by _Infusion_ will give a perfect _Green_ to _Water_.

11. §. But although the _Green Leavs_ will not give their _visible
Colour_, by _Infusion_ in _Water_; yet they will give most other
_Colours_, as well as the _Flowers_ themselves. So the _Green Leavs_
of _Cinquefoyl_, give a _Tincture_ no higher than to resemble _Rhenish
Wine_; those of _Hyssop_, _Canary_; of _Strawberrey_, _Malaga_; of
_Mint_, _Muscadine_; of _Wood-Sorrel_, _Water_ and some drops of
_Claret_; of _Blood-wort_, _Water_ and a dash of _Claret_; and those
of _Bawm_ make a _Tincture_ near as _red_ as ordinary _Claret_ alone.
All _Aromatick_ hot _Plants_, give a _yellow-red Tincture_, or _colorem
ex luteo rubrum_. All _Plants_ with a _yellow Flower_ give either a
pale _citrine_ or _yellowish Tincture_; and the like. Yet all give not
their _Tincture_ in the same space of time; some requiring a fortnight,
others a week, others five, three or two days, and some but one, or
half a day. From hence it appears, that the _Colours_ of most _Flowers_
are begun in the _Leavs_; only _Green_ being therein the _predominant
Colour_, as a _veil_ spred over them, conceils all the rest. But
passing on into the _Flower_, where the _Aer-Vessels_, as is aforesaid,
are under the dominion of the _Lymphæducts_; they show themselves
distinctly.


12. §. A THIRD and the last _Menstruum_ I made use of, was _Spirit_
of _Wine_. And here it is to be remarqued; That as _Oyl_ rarely takes
a _Red_, there being but one known _Instance_ of it; nor _Water_,
a _Green_: So neither _Spirit_ of _Wine_, a _Blew_. I have tryed
with several _blew Flowers_, as of _Lark-heel_, _Violet_, _Mallows_,
_Burrage_, and others, whereof it will not take the least _Tincture_.

13. §. Again though no _Blew Flowers_, that I know of, will give a
_Blew Tincture_ to _Spirit_ of _Wine_: yet having been for some days
infused in the said _Spirit_, and the _Spirit_ still remaining in a
manner _Limpid_, and void of the least _Ray_ of _Blew_; if you drop
into it a little _Spirit_ of _Sulphur_, it is somewhat surprizing to
see, that it immediately strikes it into a full _Red_, as if it had
been _Blew_ before: and so, if you drop _Spirit_ of _Sal Armoniac_ or
other _Alkaly_ upon it, it presently strikes it _Green_. Which further
confirms what have been before said of the _Causes_ of _Vegetable
Colours_.

14. §. It is also observable, That the _Green Leaves_ of _Bawm_, which
give a _Muscadine Red_, with some _Rays_ of _Claret_, to _Water_, gives
a pure and perfect _Green_ to _Spirit_ of _Wine_: and is the only
_Plant_ of all that I have yet tryed, which doth the like.

15. §. It is likewise to be noted, That both _Yellow_ and _Red
Flowers_ give a stronger and fuller _Tincture_ to _Water_, than to
_Spirit_ of _Wine_; as in the _Tinctures_ of _Cowslip_, _Poppys_,
_Clove-July-Flowers_ and _Roses_, made both in _Water_ and _Spirit_ of
_Wine_, and compared together, is easily seen. So that for _Tinctures_
made with _Flowers_, whether for _Medicines_, or other purposes,
_Water_, with respect to the _Colour_, is the better _Menstruum_. I say
for _Tinctures_ made with _Flowers_; for there are some other _Parts_,
especially _Gumms_, as _Gamboja_, _Myrrh_ and _Aloes_, which give
their _Tinctures_ full and clear, only to _Spirit_ of _Wine_. Some of
which are used by _Leather-Gilders_, and others, for the washing over
of _Silver_, so as to give it the _Colour_ of _Gold_. Thus far of the
_Colours_ of _Plants_ as they appear upon _Infusion_.




                               CHAP. III.

         _Of the COLOURS of_ Plants _produced by their_ Mixture
                          _with other Bodies._


THE last general Enquiry proposed to be made, was this, After what
manner they would exhibite themselves upon the _Mixture_ of those
_Infusions_, or of any one of them with some other _Liquor_.

2. §. A strong _Infusion_, or the _Juyce_ of the _Leavs_ of
_Rose-Tree_, _Raspis_, _Strawberry_, _Cynquefoyle_, _Goosberry_,
_Primrose_, _Jerusalem Cowslip_, _Bears-eare_, _Bearsfoot_, _Peony_,
_Bistort_, _Lawrel_, _Goats-beard_, droped upon _Steel_, make a _Purple
Tincture_. But that of _Vine Leaves_ scarce maketh any _Tincture_ at
all. So that there is something else besides _Sowerness_ concurring to
the _Purple_ upon _Steel_.

3. §. _Saccharum Saturni_ droped on a _Tincture_ of _Red Roses_,
turneth it to a _faint pale Green_.

4. §. _Salt_ of _Tartar_ droped upon the same _Tincture_, turneth it to
a _deeper Green_.

5. §. _Spirit_ of _Harts Horn_ droped upon a _Tincture_ of the _Flower_
of _Lark-heel_ and _Borage_ turn them to a _verdegreese Green_.

6. §. _Spirit_ of _Harts Horn_ droped on most _green Leavs_ doth not
change them at all. The like Effects have _Aq. Calcis_, and _Spirit_ of
_S. Armoniac_.

7. §. These _Experiments_ seem to confirm, That it is some _Alkaline_
or other like _Salt_ in the _Aer_, which is _predominant_ in the
production of _Green_ in the _Leavs_ of _Plants_.

8. §. _Salt_ of _Tartar_ droped on the _white Flowers_ of _Daisy_,
changeth them into a _light Green_. Which as it further confirms
the aforesaid _Position_; so likewise argues, That _Whiteness_ in
_Flowers_, is not always from the defect of _Tincture_: but that there
may be _White_, as well as _Yellow_, _Green_, _Red_ or _Blew Tinctures_.

9. §. _Spirit_ of _Sulphur_ droped on the _green Leavs_ of _Adonis
Flower_, _Everlasting Pease_, and _Holy Oak_, turns them all _Yellow_.

10. §. _Spirit_ of _Sulphur_ on a _Tincture_ of _Saffron_ changeth it
not.

11. §. _Spirit_ of _Sulphur_ on the _Yellow Flower_ of _Crowfoot_
alters them not. Neither are they changed by the _Affusion_ of
_Alkalies_.

12. §. So that it seemeth, that in all _Yellows_, the _Sulphureous
Acid_ and _Alkaline Parts_ are all more equal.

13. §. _Spirit_ of _Sulphur_ on a _Tincture_ of _Violets_ turns it from
_Blew_ to a true _Lacke_, or midle _Crimson_.

14. §. _Spirit_ of _Sulphur_ upon a _Tincture_ of _Clove-July-Flowers_
makes a bright blood _Red_. Into the like _Colour_, it hightens a
_Tincture_ of _Red Roses_.

15. §. So that as _Alkalys_, or other _Analogous Salts_, are
_predominant_ in _Greens_, so _Acids_ in _Reds_, especially in the
brighter _Reds_, in the _Leavs_ and _Flowers_ of _Plants_. Hence it
is, that _Spirit_ of _Nitre_ droped upon the _Blew Flower_ of _Ladies
Looking-Glass_, _Larkspur_, _Borage_, turns them all _Red_, _sc._
into the _Red_ of _Common Lychnis_. But (which is particularly to be
noted) being droped on the said _Red Flowers_ of _Lychnis_, alters them
little or nothing: because, that very _Colour_ is therein produced by a
copious admixture of the like _Principle_.

16. §. The Summ therefore of what hath now been said, of the _Causes_
of _Vegetable Colours_, is this: That while their _Sulphur_ and _Saline
Principles_, only swim together, and are not as yet united into one
_Precipitate_, no _Colour_ results from them, but the _Contents_ are
rather _Limpid_; as usually in the _Root_, and many other _Parenchymous
Parts_.

17. §. When they are united, and the _Alkaline_ are _predominant_, they
produce a _Green_.

18. §. When the _Sulphur_ and the _Alkaline_ are more equal, they
produce a _Tauny_.

19. §. When the _Sulphur_, _Acid_ and _Alkaline_, there a _Yellow_.

20. §. When the _Sulphur predominant_, and the _Acid_ and _Alkaline_
equal, there a _Blew_.

21. §. When the _Sulphur_ and _Acid_ are _predominant_ to the
_Alkaline_, then a _Purple_.

22. §. When the _Sulphur predominant_ to the _Alkaline_ and the _Acid_
to them both, a _Scarlet_.

23. §. _Lastly_, When the _Acid predominant_ to the _Alkaline_, and the
_Sulphur_ to them both, a _Blood-Red_: which is the highest and most
_Sulphurious Colour_ in Nature.

24. §. From the _Premises_, divers Rules do also result for the making
of _Tinctures_, either for _Medicines_, or for any other purposes.

25. §. I shall only add one or two Notes. As first, that of all
_Colours_, _Yellows_ are the most fixed and unfading. As for instance,
if you drop either a _Solution_ of _Tartar_, or of _Spirit_ of
_Sulphur_ upon a _Tincture_ of the _Yellow Flowers_ of _Crowfoot_, of
_Adonis_, or of _Saffron_, neither of them will alter their _Colour_.
Which shewes the strength of most _Yellows_, to resist all manner of
impressions from the _Aer_.

26. §. Again, that the use of _Salts_, is not only to highten or deepen
_Colours_, but also to fix and make them permanent. As for Instance,
The _Tincture_ of _Clove-July-Flowers_, made either with _Water_ or
_Spirit_ of _Wine_ being exposed to the _Aer_, will often turn into
a _Blackish Purple_. But the addition of a few drops of _Spirit_ of
_Sulphur_, doth not only highten the _Colour_, but renders it stable
and permanent.

27. §. Likewise, of _Salts_ themselves there is choice to be made.
For there are some, which although they fix the _Colour_, yet, will a
little _give_, as we say, and not hold throughly dry; as most _Lixivial
Salts_, and _Stillatious Acids_. But there are some _Salts_, which
will not _give_ in the least, as _Alum_, that in _Lime-Water_ and
some others; which latter, is so far from being moystened, that it is
rather petrified by the _Aer_. For which reason I take it to be one of
the best _Liquors_ for a stable and permanent _Green_, and some other
_Colours_.

28. §. Amongst all _Water-Colours_, the rarest, and most difficult
to make clear bright and permanent, is a _Blew_. There are many
_Flowers_ of an excellent _Blew_, as those of _Bugloss_, _Lark-heel_
and others; but they easily fade. And there are very few _Flowers_
that will strike into a _Blew_ by any _Liquor_; being almost all
changeable into _Green_, _Purple_ or _Red_. Yet some few there are, in
which this _Colour_ may be produced. As for instance, the _Flower_ of
_Lathyrus_ or _Parseverlasting_; which upon the affusion of _Spirit_
of _Harts-Horn_ is changed from a _Peach_, to as pure a _Blew_, as the
best _Ultramarine_: that which hitherto is, I think, wanting in _Water
Colours_. _Spirit_ of _Harts Horn_ was the _Liquor_ I used; but I
question not, but that other _Alkalies_, and particularly _Lime-Water_,
will have the like Effect, and so render it the more stable.

29. §. From what hath been said, we may likewise be confirmed in the
use of the already known _Rules_, and directed unto others yet unknown,
in order to the variation of the _Colours_ of _Flowers_ in their
Growth. The effecting of this, by putting the _Colour_ desired in the
_Flower_, into the _Body_ or _Root_ of the _Plant_, is vainly talked of
by some: being such a piece of cunning, as for the obtaining a painted
face, to eat good store of _white_ and _Red Lead_.

30. §. The best known _Rules_ are these Two; First, that the _Seed_
be used above any other part, if the variation of the _Colour_ be
intended. One reason whereof is, because that part being but very
small, the _Tinctures_ of the _Soyl_ will have the greater over
proportion to those of the _Seed_. Besides, the tender and _Virgin
Seed_, being committed to the Soyl, will more easily take any peculiar
_Tincture_ from it, then an other _Part_, which is not so susceptive,
and hath been tinctur’d already. All the strange varieties in
_Carnations_, _Tulips_, and other _Flowers_ are made this way.

31. §. The other _Rule_ is, To change the _Soyl_, or frequently to
transplant from one _Bed_ to another. By which means, the _Plant_, is
as it were, _superimpregnated_ with several _Tinctures_, which are
prolifick of several _Colours_; which way is taken for _Roots_ and
_Slips_.

32. §. The consideration whereof, and of the foregoing _Experiments_,
may direct us not only in changing the _Bed_, but also in compounding
the _Soyl_, as by mixing such and such _Salts_, or _Bodies_ impregnated
with such _Salts_, I say by mixing these Bodies in such a proportion,
with the _Soyl_, as although they have no _Colour_ in themselves,
yet may be effectual to produce a great variety of _Colours_ in the
_Plants_ they nourish; supplying the _Plants_ with such _Tinctures_, as
shall concur with the _Aer_, to strike or precipitate their _Sulphur_
into so many several _Colours_, after the manner above explicated: and
so to bring even Natures Art of _Painting_, in a great part, into our
own power.

                                 PLANTS.

           Read before the _Royal Society_, _March 25. 1675_.




                                CHAP. I.

  _Of the several Sorts of SIMPLE and COMPOUNDED_ Tasts; _and the
     DEGREES of both._


I HAVE formerly published some Notes, concerning _Tasts_. ♦ _Idea,
§. 29._ & _Anat. of R. P. 2. §. 68_, &c. ♦ Since then, I have made
other _Observations_ upon the same Subject: and these have produced
further _Thoughts_. I will summ up all in giveing an account, First,
of the _Diversities_; and then, of the _Causes_ of _Tasts_, chiefly in
_Plants_.

2. §. The _Diversities_ of _Tasts_ are so many, and so considerable;
that it seemeth strange, to see the matter treated of both by
_Philosophers_ and _Physicians_, with so much scantness and defect. For
the _Subject_ is not barren, but yieldeth much and pleasant _Variety_.
And doth also appear to be of great import unto _Medicine_. Besides, it
is preposterous to discourse of the _Causes_ of _Tasts_, before we have
taken an account of their _Diversities_; Whereof therefore I shall in
the first place, exhibit the following _Scheme_.


3. §. TASTS may be distinguished by these Three general ways. First,
with respect to the _Sensation_ it self. Secondly, with respect to its
_Duration_ and _Terms_. Thirdly, with respect to its _Subject_.

4. §. The _Sensation_ it self is differenced two ways, by its
_Species_, and by its _Degrees_. With respect to the _Species_, _Tasts_
are _Simple_, or _Compounded_. By _Simple Tasts_, I mean not such, as
are never found in conjunction with other _Tasts_: but the _Simple_ or
_Single Modes_ of _Tast_, although they are mixed with divers others
in the same _Body_. As for example, the _Taste_ of a _Peppin_, is
_Acidulcis_; of _Rhubarb_, _Amarastringens_; and therefore _Compounded_
in both. Yet in the _Peppin_, the _Acid_ is one _Simple Taste_, and
the _Sweet_ another; and so in _Rhubarb_, the _Bitter_ is one _Simple
Taste_, and the _Astringent_ is another.

5. §. Two faults have here been committed; the defective _Enumeration_
of _Simple Tasts_; and reckoning them indistinctly among some others
which are _Compounded_.


6. §. SIMPLE _Tasts_, (of which, properly so called, there are commonly
reckoned but Six or Seven Sorts,) are, at least Sixteen. _First_,
_Bitter_, as in _Wormwood_: to which, the contrary is _Sweet_, as in
_Sugar_. _Thirdly_, _Sower_, as in _Vinegar_: to which, the contrary
is _Salt_. _Fifthly_, _Hot_, as in _Cloves_: whereto, the contrary is
_Cold_. For we may as properly say, a _Cold Taste_, as a _Hot Taste_:
there being some _Bodies_, which do manifestly impress the _Sense_
of _Cold_ upon the _Tongue_, though not by _Touch_. So doth _Sal
Prunellæ_, although the _Liquor_ wherein it is dissolved, be first
warmed.

7. §. _Seventhly_, _Aromatick_. For it doth not more properly agree to
an _Odor_ than a _Taste_, to be _Aromatick_. And that an _Aromatick
Taste_, is distinct from an _Hot_, is clear; In that, there are many
_Bodies_ of a _Hot Taste_, some meanly and others vehemently _Hot_;
which yet are not in the least _Aromatick_: as amongst others, is
apparent in _Euphorbium_. So that although an _Aromatick Taste_ be
often conjoyned with _Heat_; yet it is not that _Heat_ it self, but
another distinct _Sense_.

8. §. _Eighthly_, _Nauseous_ or _Malignant_, contrary to the former.
Such as is perceived, together with the _Astringent_ and _Bitter_, in
_Rhubarb_; or with the _Bitter_, and _Sweet_, in _Aloes_. It may be
called _Malignant_, because distastful although mixed in a low degree
with other _Tasts_: whereas other _Tasts_ will render one another
grateful.

9. §. Again, _Tasts_ may properly be said, to be _Soft_ or _Hard_. A
_Soft Taste_, is either _Vapid_, as in _Watery Bodies_, _Whites_ of
_Eggs_, _Starch_, _Fine Boles_, &c. Or _Unctuous_, as in _Oyls_, _Fat_,
&c.

10. §. A _Hard Taste_ is Fourfold, _sc._ _Penetrant_, _Stupifacient_,
_Astringent_, _Pungent_. Contrary to a _Vapid_, are _Penetrant_ and
_Stupifacient_.

11. §. _Penetrant_, is a kind of _Taste_, which worketh it self
into the _Tongue_ (as some _Insects_ into the _Skin_) without any
_Pungency_; as in the _Root_ and _Leavs_ of _Wild Cucumer_.

12. §. _Stupifacient_, as in the _Root_ of _Black Hellebore_. Which
being chew’d, and for sometime reteined upon the _Tongue_; after a
few minutes, it seemeth to be benum’d and affected with a kind of
_Paralytick Stupor_; or as when it hath been a little burnt with eating
or supping of any thing too hot.

13. §. Contrary to an _Unctuous Taste_, are _Astringent_, and
_Pungent_; as in _Galls_, and _Spirit_ of _Sal Armoniack_.

14. §. Again, _Tasts_ are either _Continual_, as most commonly: or
_Intermittent_; as that of _Dracontium_, especially in the _Root_.
For after it seems to be lost and extinguished; it will then again
(chiefly upon the _Collision_ of the _Tongue_ and _Goomes_) be plainly
heightened and reviv’d.

15. §. _Lastly_, _Tasts_ are either _Still_, as usually; or may be
called _Tremulous_, as the _Heat_ produced by _Pyrethrum_. _Distinct_
from that of _Cloves_, _Ginger_, and many other _Hot Bodies_, in that
there the _Heat_ is _still_; but here in _Pyrethrum_, ’tis joyned
with a kind of _Vibration_: as when a _Flame_ is brandished with a
_Lamp-Furnace_. Thus far of the Sorts of _Simple Tasts_.


16. §. COMPOUNDED _Tasts_ are very numerous; being made by the various
_Conjunction_ of _Simple Tasts_, as _Words_ are of _Letters_. Sometimes
of two, as in _Saccharum Saturni_, of _Astringent_ and _Sweet_.
Sometimes three, as in _Aloes_, _Malignant_, _Bitter_ and _Sweet_; in
_Rhubarb_, _Malignant_, _Astringent_ and _Bitter_. Sometimes four, as
in _Agarick_, _Malignant_, _Astringent_, _Bitter_ and _Sweet_. And in
some _Bodies_, five or six _Species_ may be joyned together.

17. §. For the more accurate _Observation_ whereof, there are these
easie _Rules_. That not too many be tasted at one time: least the
_Tongue_ being surcharged, become less critical. That the _Mouth_ be
washed with warm water betwixt every tasting. And that those things be
first tasted which produce a less durable _Taste_; that so one may be
throughly extinguished, before another be try’d.

18. §. Of the numerous _Conjunctions_ of _Tasts_, which may thus be
observed, there are only Six to which the penury of _Language_ hath
allowed (if I may call them) _Proper Names_, sc. _Acerbus_, _Austerus_,
_Acris_, _Muriaticus_, _Lixivus_ & _Nitrosus_. Most of which are
commonly taken in to make up the number of _Simple Tasts_. But very
improperly; being all of them _Compounded_ and _Decompounded Tasts_: to
which _Class_ they ought therefore to be refer’d. For

19. §. _Austere_, is _Astringent_ and _Bitter_; as in the green and
soft _Stones_ of _Grapes_.

20. §. _Acerb_, properly so called, is _Astringent_ and _Acid_; as in
the _Juyce_ of unripe _Grapes_.

21. §. _Acris_, is also _Compounded_. For first, simply _Hot_, it
is not: because there are many _Hot Bodies_, which are not _Acria_;
as the _Roots_ of _Zedoary_, _Yarrow_, _Contrayerva_. Nor Secondly,
is it simply _Pungent_, because there are also _Bodies_, which are
_Non-acria pungentia_; of which kind is the _Root_ of _Arum_. Wherefore
_Acritude_, is _Pungency_ joyned with _Heat_.

22. §. _Muriatick_, is _Saltness_ joyned with some _Pungency_, as in
common _Salt_.

23. §. _Lixivial_, is _Saltness_ joyned with _Pungency_ and _Heat_.

24. §. _Nitrous_, is _Saltness_ joyned with _Pungency_ and _Cold_.

25. §. Besides these Six, or perhaps one or two more, there are, as is
said, a great number of _Conjunctions_, for which we have no _Proper
Names_. For admit that there were but _Ten Species_ of _Simple Tasts_,
_sc._ these _Ten_; _Amarus_, _Dulcis_, _Acidus_, _Salsus_, _Calidus_,
_Frigidus_, _Aromaticus_, _Malignus_, _Astringens_, _Pungens_. And
of these _Ten_, but _Two_, or at most, but _Three_ to be compounded
together in any one _Body_. If only _Two_, they produce 45 _Compounded
Tasts_. For the _First_, may be compounded with all the 9 following;
the _Second_, with all the 8 following; and so, the rest: which
together make 45. But if the same _Ten_ be compounded by _Threes_
together; they produce no less than 120 _Variations_: as by the _Table_
made of them all doth plainly appear.

26. §. Some few of the _Conjunctions_ therein set down, may not be
found actually existent in _Nature_. The abatement of which, will
be much more than compensated two ways. _First_, by the other _Six
Species_ of _Simple Tasts_, which are also sometimes compounded. And by
other more complex _Conjunctions_, as of many _Quadruples_, and perhaps
some _Quintuple_ or _Sextuple_ ones. Thus far of the _Simple Species_,
and _Conjunctions_ of _Tasts_.


27. §. THE DEGREES of _Tasts_ are also numerous; and each _Species_,
in every _Conjunction_, capable of _Variation_ herein. For the more
accurate observing whereof, it will be best, To take those _Bodies_,
whose _Tasts_ are, as near as may be, the same in _Specie_: and that
those be first tasted, which are less strong; whereby the true _Degree_
will be more precisely taken.

28. §. The _Tasts_ of _Bodies_ will thus appear to be varied, in
most _Species_ unto _Five Degrees_; and in some of them, unto _Ten_.
So the _Root_ of _Turmerick_, is bitter in the _First Degree_; of
_Gentian_, in the _Tenth_. The _Root_ of _Carduus Benedictus_, is _Hot_
in the _First Degree_; the _Green Pods_ or _Seed-Cases_ of _Clematis
peregrina_, in the _Tenth_. So that, allowing some to vary under
_Five_; yet by a moderate estimate, we may reckon every _Species_,
one with another, to be varied by at least _Five Degrees_. Which
being added to the several _Species_ of _Tasts_, in all the _Treble
Conjunctions_ of the aforesaid _Table_, come to 1800 sensible and
defineable _Variations_ of _Taste_. And these are the _Diversities_ of
_Taste_, with respect to the _Sensation_ it self.




                                CHAP. II.

                   _Of the DURATION and several TERMES
                               of_ Tasts.


THE next general way of distinguishing _Tasts_, is by their _Duration_,
and their _Terms_, or their _Motion_ of _Intension_ and _Remission_
from one _Degree_ to another. For there are many _Tasts_, which have
their _Motions_ analogous to those of _Diseases_; and by those may be
distinguished in the same manner. For as of _Diseases_, so of _Tasts_,
there are Four _Times_, as _Physicians_ call them, or _Terms_ of
_Motion_; sc. _Principium_, _Augmentum_, _Status_, _& Declinatio_.

2. §. For the distinct observing of which, those _Bodies_ which
are hard, and so their tastable parts less easily extractable by
the _Tongue_, should be reduced to a fine _Powder_: otherwise,
the true measure of the _Principium_ will be lost. And for the
precise measuring of all the _Four Termes_, it should be done by a
_Minute-Watch_ or a _Minute-Glass_. For so it will appear, that the
_Variations_ of each, are divers and remarquable.

3. §. To instance first in those of the _Principium_. Which I call,
That space of time, betwixt the first _Contact_ of the _Body_ to
be tasted, and the first manifest _Perception_ of the _Taste_. For
Example, those _Bodies_ which are _Acid_, or _Bitter_, as _Vinegar_
or _Wormwood_, are presently perceiv’d, _quatenus Acid_ or _Bitter_,
upon the first _Contact_; or have _Principium brevissimum_. Those
_Bodies_ which are _Acrid_, have their _Principium_ somewhat longer.
So the _Seed Cases_ of _Clematis peregrina_, although they have a
vehement _Acritude_, even in the Tenth _Degree_; yet is not that
_Acritude_ so soon tasted, as the _Bitterness_ of _Roses_, which is
but in the second. But the _Principium_ of _Hot Tasts_, is generally
longer than that of any other. So the _Bitterness_ of the _Root_ of
_Black-Hellebore_, which exceedeth not the second _Degree_, is yet
presently tasted: but the _Heat_ proceeding from the same _Root_, and
which ascendeth to the third _Degree_, is not perceived at all, till
after two full _Minutes_. And so the _Bitterness_ of _Enula_, which
exceedeth not the 4ᵗʰ _Degree_, yet is sooner tasted than its _Heat_,
which ascendeth to the 8ᵗʰ.

4. §. Next, in those of the _Augment_. Which I call, That space,
betwixt the first _Perception_ of the _Taste_, till it be come to the
heighth. So the _Heat_ of _Galangale_, is not only presently perceived,
but ariseth to the heighth within half a _Minute_. But the _Heat_ of
the _Root_ of _Enula_, comes not to the heighth till after a whole
_Minute_. And the _Heat_ of _Black-Hellebore_, not till after four full
_Minutes_ from the first _Contact_.

5. §. The _Status_, or space wherein the _Taste_ continues in
its heighth, is also divers. So the _Heat_ of the _Seed-Case_ of
_Helleboraster_, comes to its heighth, and begins to decline within
half a _Minute_; that of the _Root_ of _Garden-Scurvygrass_, not till
after a _Minute_; and that of the _Root_ of _Asarum_, not till after
two full _Minutes_.

6 §. And _Lastly_, the _Declination_, or the space betwixt the first
_Remission_ of the _Taste_, and its total _Extinction_. For instance,
The _Leavs_ of _Millefolium_, are _Bitter_ in the 4ᵗʰ _Degree_, and
_Hot_ only in the 1ˢᵗ yet the _Heat_ continues for sometime, and the
_Bitter_ presently vanishes. _Calamus Aromaticus_, is _Bitter_ in the
4ᵗʰ _Degree_, _Hot_ in the 1ˢᵗ, and _Aromatick_ in the 3ᵈ: yet the
_Bitter_ quickly vanishes, the _Heat_ continues two _Minutes_, and the
_Aromatick_ seven or eight. The _Heat_ of the _Root_ of _Contrayerra_,
is extended, almost to two _Minutes_; the _Pungency_ of _Jalap_, almost
to six; the _Heat_ of _Garden Scurvygrass_, to seven or eight. And even
the _Bitterness_ of _Wild Cucumer_, to near a quarter of an hour. But
the _Heat_ of _Euphorbium_ dureth much longer, as also that of _Black
Hellebore_, _sc._ above half an hour.

7. §. So that the _Augmentum_, is seldom extended beyond Four or Six
_Minutes_, from the first _Contact_: but the _Declination_, sometimes
to Thirty, Fourty, or more. Thus far of the _Terms_ of _Tast_, or the
manner of their _Intension_ and _Remission_.




                               CHAP. III.

                   _Of the SUBJECT or SEAT of_ Tasts.


THE _Third_ and _Last_ way of distinguishing _Tasts_, is by their
_Subject_, or the _Part_ or _Parts_ where they are either wholly or
chiefly perceived. And so, _Tasts_ are either _Fixed_, or _Movable_.

2. §. A _Fixed Tast_, is that which keepeth within the compass of some
one _Part_, all the time of its _Duration_; as upon the _Tip_, or the
_Root_ of the _Tongue_, or other _Part_.

3. §. A _Movable Taste_, is either _Diffusive_ or _Transitive_.

4. §. A _Diffusive Taste_, I call that, which by degrees spreads
abroad into divers _Parts_, and yet in the mean time, adheres to that
_Part_ in which it is first perceived. So the _Bitterness_ in the
dryed _Roots_ of _Black Hellebore_, is first felt on the _Tip_ of the
_Tongue_; from whence it spreads it self to the midle of the same. And
the _Bitterness_ of the _Leavs_ of _Wild Cucumer_, spreads from the
_Tip_, to the _Root_ of the _Tongue_.

5. §. A _Transitive Taste_, is that, which after sometime, wholly
quitting the _Part_ wherein it is first perceived, is thence transfered
into some other _Part_: as the _Bitterness_ of _Gentian_, imediately
from the _Tip_, to the midle of the _Tongue_. And most of the
_Diffusive_, are also _Transitive_.

6. §. The several _Parts_ which these ways become, and with some
latitude may be called, the _Seats_ of _Tasts_, are, the _Lips_,
_Tongue_, _Palate_, _Throat_ and _Gulet_.

7. §. Upon the _Lips_, the _Root_ of white _Hellebore_, as also
of _Pyrethrum_, being chewed, make a sensible _Impression_; which
continues (like the flame of a _Coal_ betwixt in and out) for 9 or 10
_Minutes_. But the _Heat_ in other _Parts_ much longer.

8. §. Upon the _Tongue_, _Tasts_ are perceived in Three places, as
hath been intimated. On the _Tip_ or _Cone_ of the _Tongue_; as most
commonly. On or near the _Basis_ of the _Tongue_; where the _Taste_
of the _Leavs_ of _Wild Cucumer_ chiefly fixeth it self. Or on the
_Vertex_ or midle of the _Tongue_; in which place it is observable,
that the _Tast_ of _Gentian_, _Colocynthis_, and divers other _Bodies_,
is then considerably strong, when not at all perceived at the _Tip_ of
the _Tongue_ or in any other _Part_.

9. §. Upon the _Palate_ or _Roofe_ of the _Mouth_, the _Root_, as I
take it, of _Deadly Nightshade_ maketh its chief _Impression_; and
there continues about four _Minutes_ in some degree.

10. §. The _Throat_, or the _Uvula_, _Larinx_ and other adjacent
_Parts_ are oftentimes the _Seat_ of _Taste_. For there are many
_Bodies_, which although they have scarce any _Taste_ upon the
_Tongue_, or any other of the aforesaid _Parts_, yet make a strong
_Impression_ on the _Throat_: as the _Leavs_ of little _Daisy_, little
_Celandine_, and of _Pimpinel_; as also the _Roots_ of _Jalap_,
_Mercury_, _Asparagus_ and others. Which being chewed make little or
no _Impression_ on the _Tongue_, but their _Juyce_ being swallowed,
causeth a kind of pricking in the _Throat_; as when one is provoked by
a sharp _Rheum_.

11. §. And that this _Taste_ or _Sense_, is truly distinct from
either the _Heat_, _Pungency_, or _Acritude_ upon the _Tongue_, it
is hence further manifest; In that _Pyrethrum_, which is very _Hot_,
and _Cortex Winteranus_ which is very _Pungent_ upon the _Tongue_;
yet their _Juyce_ being swallowed, causeth no _Heat_, _Pungency_ or
_Exasperation_ in the _Throat_.

12. §. _Lastly_, if we will take the word (_Tast_) in a larger sense,
the _Oesophagus_ it self may be said to be sometimes the _Subject_
thereof; as of the _Heat_ produced by the _Root_ of _Common Wormwood_.
For of this _Heat_ it is remarquable, that being first perceived on the
_Tip_ of the _Tongue_, it thence maketh its _transit_ to the _Root_
of the _Tongue_, and so into the _Throat_, and by degrees descends
into the very _Gulet_; where it seemeth to warm the _Stomach_; and so
continues, in some degree, almost ¼ of an hour. And the _Transition_
and _Descent_ of this _Heat_ is made, although none of the _Juyce_ be
swallowed. And in this maner _Tasts_ are distinguished with respect to
their _Subject_.

13. §. So that the general _Diversities_ of _Tasts_ are these. With
respect to their _Species_, they are _Simplices vel Compositi_; To
their _Degree_, _Remissi vel Intensi_; To their _Duration_, _Breves vel
Diuturni_; To the _Terms_ of their _Motion_, _Celeres vel Tardi_; and
lastly, To their _Subject_, _Fixi, Diffusivi & Transitivi_.


14. §. I HAVE thus endeavoured to draw up a _Scheme_ or _Inventory_ of
the several sorts of _Tasts_. In which, some may think, that I have
over done: and that as _Galen_ hath been censured for being too curious
in the _Distinctions_ of _Pulses_; so have I been, in these of _Tasts_.
Not to enquire now, how far the _Differences_ of the _Pulse_ may be
extended, or be fit to be taken notice of; I shall only say, That we
have not so much reason to censure him, if he hath given us some few
which are coincident; as we have to thank him, for observing so many
which are really distinct.

15. §. By the _Scheme_ of _Tasts_ here represented, we may be able,
so to enumerate the _Modes_ of any _Tast_, as to make a _Scientifick
Definition_ of it. Which is pleasant _Instruction_ to any inquisitive
mind; these things being all matter of sense and demonstration; wherein
lyeth, though not always the most plausible, yet the most satisfying
_Philosophy_; and where men, after they are grown weary with turning
round, are oftentimes contented to rest.

16. §. But the usefulness of this _Schem_ will further appear, in two
respects; _sc._ In conducting us to a cleerer and more particular
_Explication_ of the _Causes_ of _Tasts_: and the _Investigation_ of
the _Virtues_ of those _Bodies_ in which they reside. Whereof in the
following _Chapters_.




                                CHAP. IV.

                        _Of the CAUSES of_ Tasts.


TO speak of the _Causes_ of _Tasts_, before we have well enumerated and
distinguished them; is to provide _Furniture_ for a _House_, before the
_Roomes_ have been counted and measured out. But the _Varieties_ of
_Tasts_ having been first laid down; it will induce us to believe, and
investigate as great a variety in their _Causes_.

2. §. Now the _Causes_ of _Tasts_, particularly of the _Tasts_ of
_Plants_, whereof we chiefly speak, are, in general, these Four or
Five, _sc._ The _Bed_ out of which they grow; The _Aer_ in which they
stand; The _Parts_ of which they consist; The several _Fermentations_
under which their _Juyces_ pass; And the _Organs_ by which their
_Tastable Parts_ are perceiv’d: as will appear upon _Instance_.

3. §. But the immediate _Causes_, besides the _Organs_ of _Taste_,
are the _Principles_ of _Plants_. As many of which, as come under
the notice of _Sense_, we have already supposed to be these Seven,
_Alkaline_, _Acid_, _Aer_, _Water_, _Oyl_, _Spirit_ and _Earth_. The
_Particles_ both of _Alkaline_ and _Acid Salts_, are all _angular_
and _poynted_. Those of _Aer_, properly and strictly so called, are
_Elastick_ or _Springy_; and therefore also _Crooked_; as I have
likewise formerly conjectured. And I find the Learned _Borelli_, in a
Book of his since then published, to be of the same Opinion. Those of
all _Fluid Bodies_, _quà Fluid_, and therefore of _Water_, _Oyl_ and
_Spirit_, I conceive to be _Globular_, but _hollow_, and with holes
in their Sides. Those of _Water_, to be larger _Globes_, with more
_holes_; those of _Oyl_, to be lesser, with fewer _holes_; and those
of _Spirit_ the least. Lastly, that the particles of _Earth_ are also
_Round_; yet angular; and nearer to a _solid_.

4. §. These _Principles_ affect the _Organs_ of _Sense_, according
to the variety of their _Figures_, and of their _Mixture_. So those
which are sharp or poynted; and those which are _springy_; are fitted
to produce any stronger _Taste_: and those which are round, are apt,
of their own _Nature_, to produce a _weaker_ or _softer_ one. And so
by the diversities of their _Mixture_; not only with respect to their
_Proportion_, but also the very _Mode_ of their _Conjunction_. Hence
it is, that many _Bodies_ which abound with _Salt_, as _Ambar_ with
an _Acid_, and the _Bones_ of _Land-Animals_ with an _Alkaline_, have
notwithstanding but a weak _Tast_; the _Saline Parts_ being in the
former drowned in the _Oyl_, and in the latter also buried in the
_Earth_.

5. §. The same is further confirmed by an _Experiment_ mentioned in a
former _Discourse_; ♦ Of _Mixt._ Ch. 5. ♦ _sc._ the _Transmutation_ of
_Oyl_ of _Anise-Seeds_, with the help of _Oyl_ of _Vitriol_, into a
_Rosin_. For both those _Liquors_, though so strongly tasted, apart;
yet the _Rosin_ made of them, being well washed, hath a very mild
_Taste_, and without any smatch of that in either of the _Liquors_.
Whence it follows, that the very _Mode_ of _Mixture_ is sufficient, not
only for the variation of the _Degrees_ in any one _Species_ of _Tast_;
but also for the destroying of one _Species_, and the introducing of
another.


6. §. THESE things being premised, I conceive, That as an _Unctuous
Tast_ dependeth upon _Oyl_; so a _Vapid_ either on _Water_, or _Earth_:
or upon such an intimate _Mixture_ of other _Principles_, as renders
them indissoluble by the _Saliva_, and so, in a manner, untastable.

7. §. That a _Pungent_, is made either by an _Alkaly_ or an _Acid_
sharpned or whetted; that is, cleared from the soyl of other
_Principles_; as in the _Spirit_ of _Sal Armoniac_ or of _Sulphur_.
And so in those _Plants_ which have a _Pungent Tast_; whose _Juyces_
or _Tinctures_, although they consist of divers _Principles_, yet all
so loosely mixed, that being dissolved by the _Saliva_, the _Saline_
are hereupon left naked. Wherefore _biting Plants_, _qua biting_, are
_Nitrous Plants_. So that the _Juyce_ of such _Plants_, is a kind of
_Spirit_ of _Nitre_, made by the several _Parts_ of the _Plant_. Hence
_Arum_ grows best under an Hedg; where the Ground, not being exposed
to the _Sun_, but the _Aer_ only, like those _Rooms_ in _Houses_,
which are covered, is impregnated with a greater quantity of _Nitrous
Salt_. And those _Roots_ which are _Biting_, have but few or but small
_Aer-Vessels_; whereby fewer parts of the _nitroaereal Sap_ are carryed
off into the _Trunk_. For the same _Cause_, it is no wonder, that many
_Aquaticks_ are _Biting_; _Water_ being, though it self cold, yet the
_Menstruum_ by which all _Salts_ are imbibed most easily, and in laxer
state of _Commixture_ with other _Principles_.

8. §. _Penetrant_ (something slower than _Pungent_) is made by any
_Salt_ that is also soiled or guarded with _Earth_. _Sower_, by an
_Acid_ only soyled with _Earth_. _Salt_, by an _Acid_ guarded by an
_Alkaly_, and soyled with _Earth_. _Cold_, by an _Acid_ drowned in
_Water_, and soyled with _Earth_.

9. §. In all these, the _Salts_ are _predominant_; In _Heat_ the _Oyl_
or _Sulphur_. The particles whereof being _Spherick_ and _bored_ with
_holes_; those of _Salt_ stick in them, as the _Spokes_ do in the
_Hub_ of a _Wheel_, or as the _Quills_ in the _Skin_ of a _Porcupine_.
Whereby, as in _Common Fire_ the _Sparks_ of _Sulphur_ being agitated
and whirled about by the _Aer_; with the help of the _Salts_, which
stick in them, tear in pieces all kinds of _Bodies_: so here, being
agitated by the _Circulation_ of the _Blood_, they make a kind of hurry
or combustion; and so, according to the degree and strength of their
_Motion_, tear in pieces fewer or more of the _Fibers_ of the _Tongue_;
and in a greater quantity, would raise a _Blister_ upon it; the common
_Effect_ of _Fire_, or any strong _Epispastick_. So that a _Hot Tast_,
is produced by _Sulphur_ toothed or armed with _Salts_. Wherefore
all _Stillatitious Oyls_ are _Hot_; being strongly impregnated or
armed with the _Essential Salts_ of the _Plants_ from whence they are
distilled. And as those _Plants_ which are very _Parenchymous_, from
the predominancy of their _Volatile Acid_, are _biting_: So those
which are _Lignous_, that is, have a good quantity of _Lympheducts_,
from the dominion of their _Sulphur_ are commonly _Hot_. For the same
reason it is, that many both _Biting_ and _Hot Plants_, as the _Roots_
of _Dragon_, _Garden-Radish_, _Onion_, _Iris_, _Rape-Crowfoot_, &c.
being corked up in a bottle with _Water_, and set in a Cellar or other
cool place; they do all of them turn _Sower_ in a few days: The same
_Fermentation_, at once sullying the _Salts_ of the one, and disarming
the _Sulphurs_ of the other. But some, wherein the _Sulphureous_ parts
are more copious, will hardly ever become _Sower_. Hence also, some
_Plants_, whose _Roots_ are neither _Hot_, nor of any strong _Taste_,
as those of _Wild Anemone_; yet their _Leaves_ and _Flowers_ are
plainly _Caustick_: So that it seems, that as their _Juyces_ rise up
into the _Trunk_ or _Stalk_, and are therein further fermented, the
_Sulphurous Parts_ thereof, are at the same time relaxed from the other
_Principles_, and acuated with an _Aereal Salt_.

10. §. A _Stupifacient Tast_ (as the _Impression_ which some _Hot
Plants_ make upon the _Tongue_ may be called) is in some sort,
analogous to the mortifying of any part of the Body by the application
of a _Caustick_. For as there the mortification succeeds the burning
pain, so here, the _Stupifaction_, neither comes before, nor with the
_Heat_, but follows it.

11. §. _Sweetness_ is produced, sometimes by an _Alkaly_; smoothed
either by a _Sulphur_, as in _Lime-Water_; or by both a _Spirit_
and a _Sulphur_, as in the _Stillatitious Oyls_ of _Animals_. But
most commonly, by a smoothed _Acid_; as in _Malt_, _Sugar_, _Hony_.
Hence a _Sweet Taste_, is generally founded in a Sower; So Sower
_Apples_, by mellowing, and harsh _Pears_, by baking become sweet;
the _Spirit_ and _Sulphur_ being hereby at once separated from the
other _Principles_ and brought to a nearer union with the _Acid_. So
the Sower _Leaves_ of _Wood-Sorrel_, being dry’d, become sweet: and
those of a sower _Codlin_, while they hang on the _Tree_, and even
of a _Crab-Tree_, are neither _Astringent_, nor sower, but sensibly
sweet. And so commonly, wherever the said _Principles_ are a little
exalted by a soft _Fermentation_; as in the _Juyce_ of the _Stalk_ of
_Maze_ or _Indian Wheat_, which is as sweet as _Sugar_; and in the
_green Stalks_ of all sorts of _Corn_ and _Grass_, in several degrees.
So likewise _Tulips_ and some other _Roots_, being taken up, in open
weather, sometime before they _sprout_; if tasted, are as sweet as
_Liquirish_ or _Sugar_; and at no other time: not only _Fruits_, but
many _Roots_, _Seeds_, and other _Parts_, upon their first or early
_Germination_, acquiring a curious _Mellowness_, wherein, all their
_Principles_ are resolved, and their most _Spirituous Parts_ exalted
and spread over the _Acid_. Wherefore also most _Roots_, which are not
meerly long, but grow deep in the ground, have at least some of their
_Juyces_ of a sweet _Tast_; as _Liquirish_, _Eryngo_, _Hounds-Tongue_,
_Garden-Parsnep_, _Black Henbeane_, _Deadly Night-shade_, _&c._ Even
the _Juyce_ of _Horse Radish_, which bleeds at the _Lympheducts_, is of
a sweet _Taste_. And of the same kindred those which grow the deepest,
are the sweetest; as a _Parsnep_ is sweeter than a _Carrot_, especially
if you tast the bleeding _Sap_; and the _Root_ of _Common Tall Trefoyl_
tasteth somewhat like _Liquirish_, but is not near so sweet. For all
deep _Roots_, are fed with a less _Nitrous Aliment_: and being remoter
from the _Aer_, their _Juyces_ pass under much more soft and moderate
_Fermentations_.

12. §. _Bitterness_ is produced by a _Sulphur_ well impregnated, either
with an _Alkaline_, or an _Acid Salt_, but also shackled with _Earth_.
And therefore the _Bitterest Plants_, commonly yield the greatest
quantity of _Lixivial Salt_. So also many _Stillatitious Oyls_ digested
with any strong _Acid_, will acquire a _Bitter Taste_. Wherefore this
_Taste_ is often founded either in a _Hot Taste_, or a _Sweet_. Hence
it is, that the _Leaves_ of all sweet _Roots_ are _Bitter_. And that
the _Fig-Tree_, which bears a sweet _Fruit_, bleeds a _Bitter Milk_.
So likewise those _Plants_, which bear a _Bitter Stalk_, have not
_Bitter_, but _Hot Roots_, as in _Yarrow_, _Primrose_, _Wormwood_,
_Rue_, _Carduus benedictus_ &c. is manifest. So the _Coats_ of the
_Seeds_ of _Viola Lunaria_ are of a _hot_ and _biting Tast_; but the
_Seeds_ themselves, in which the _Salts_, though copious, yet are also
immersed in a greater quantity of _Oyl_, are _Bitter_. And that the
_Earthy Parts_ do also contribute something more to this, than to most
of the forementioned _Tasts_, is argued from its being more _Fixed_;
that is, the _Body_ in which it resides, is either more _Fixed_, or
else flyeth not away in that same state of conjunction, by which it
maketh a _Bitter Taste_. For whereas _Hot_, _Biting_, and divers other
_Plants_ lose the strength of their _Taste_, by drying; most of those
which are _Bitter_, do hereby increase it. And although the _Extract_
of _Dandelion_ and some other _Roots_, which are very _Bitter_, hath
scarce any _Tast_, yet generally, they are _Bitter Plants_, which are
best for the making of _Extracts_. And the distilled waters of _Plants_
which are _Hot_ and =Bitter=, notwithstanding that they always tast
high of the _Heat_, yet rarely and very faintly of the _Bitter_.

13. §. _Astringency_, is made, partly, by the further increase and
more intimate union of the _Earth_. And therefore this is seated still
in a more _Fixed Composition_, than a _Bitter_. And partly, by the
diminution of the _Sulphur_. And therefore the _Acid Parts_ ingredient
to it, either by _Fermentation_ or otherwise, are easily exposed.
_Astringency_ being the _Womb_ or _Bud_ of a _Sower_. For all or most
_Astringent Roots_ bear a sower _Leaf_, or a sower _Fruit_; as those
of all _Docks_ and _Sorrels_, _Black-Thorn_, _Dog-Rose_, and others.
Wherefore also, _Astringency_ is often found in conjunction with
_Bitter_, _Sweet_, or _Sower_; but scarce ever with _Pungent_, or _Hot_.

14. §. An _Aromatick Tast_, seems to be produced, chiefly, by a
_spirituous_, _acid_, and _volatile Sulphur_; as in _Ambar-griese_,
_Cardamon-Seeds_, many _Stillatitious Oyls_ &c. A _Nauseous_, by a
_Sulphur_ less _Spirituous_ and _Volatile_, and more _Alkaline_; as
in the _Root_ of _Dog-stones_, _Sheep scabious_, the young and green
_Leaves_ of _Coriander_, or the _Seeds_ of _Cumine_. The _Spirit_, as
it enters the _Nerves_, carrying the _Alkaline Sulphur_ along with it;
as when a City is betrayed by one of its Inhabitants to an Enemy.

15. §. An _Intermittent Taste_, as in _Arum_, seems to have its
dependance upon a simple and very pure _Nitre_, which by its subtilty
enters into the very _Concaves_ of the _Nervous Fibers_ of the
_Tongue_: and so being lodged there, is little affected or stirred,
by the _Motion_ of the _Blood_; but only when the _Tongue_ it self is
moved, at which time it causeth a kind of pricking _Taste_.

16. §. A _Tremulous Taste_, as in _Pyrethrum_, dependeth probably,
upon an _Aereal Sulphur_; which being agitated by the _Blood_ in its
_Circulation_, the _springy Motion_ or _Vibration_ of the _Aereal
Parts_ produce that _Taste_.

17. §. A _Tast_ is _Lingual_, _Guttural_, &c. according to the grosness
or fineness or other difference of the _Membranes_ into which the
_tastable parts_ are admitted. For _Tasts_ are made not meerly by the
outward _Contact_, but the _Ingress_ of the _tastable parts_. Now
the outer _Skin_ of the _Tongue_, which is commonly observed to pill
off in boyling, like the _Cuticula_ in other _Parts_, hath either no
sense, or much less than that which lies under it; and is therefore,
but a _Sieve_ or _Strainer_ to the _tastable parts_. So that being of
different fineness in the several parts of the _Tongue_; it hereby
comes to pass, that according as the _tastable parts_ of any _Plant_
are more or less penetrant, subtle, or dissoluble, they are admitted
into one part of the _Tongue_, and not another. And in the _Throat_,
the outer _Skin_ it self, seems to be the immediate _Sensory_; and so,
to be evidently affected with the _Juyces_ of some _Plants_, from which
the _Tongue_ receiveth little or no sensible _Impression_.

18. §. When the _Tast_ is _Permanent_ and _Fixed_ in some one _Part_;
it is a sign, either that the _Gustable Parts_ are less dissoluble;
or more subtle, so as to enter the _Concaves_ of the _Fibers_; and
that there is an admixture of an _Aereal Salt_, or a like _Sulphur_;
some of the parts whereof, being crooked, hang like _Hooks_ on the
_Fibers_ of the _Tongue_. For the reception of such a _Tast_, is not
to be looked upon as a wound made with a _Lancet_, and so the _Lancet_
taken away; but with the _Lancet_ sticking in the wound; until in time,
’tis carryed off by the _Circulation_ of the _Blood_; which like the
_Stream_ of a _River_ in a _Flood_, carries all before it, but those
things last, which stick in the _Mud_.

19. §. But when the _Tast_, though _Permanent_, yet is _Diffusive_ or
_Transitive_; it seems probable, that as there is a less admixture of
_Aer_; so a greater subtlety of the _Tastable Parts_, whereby they are
conveyed, through the _Nervous Fibers_, from one _Part_ to another.




                                CHAP. V.

            _Of the Judgment which may be made of the VIRTUES
                     of_ Plants, _from their_ Tasts.


AS by duly observing the _Tasts_ of _Plants_, we may be directed
to understand their _Causes_. So also the _Use_ and _Virtues_ of
those _Plants_ or _Parts_ of _Plants_ in which they reside. For the
proof whereof, an _Instance_ might be fetched from every particular
difference of _Tast_ before set down. But it may be enough, to give
these which follow.

2. §. And first, we may make no ill guess _ex Analogia_, or where we
find the same _Tast_, that there the same _Virtue_ in some kind, and
in some degree, may reside. So _Jalap_, _Mercury_, and _Daisy_, have
all of them that exasperating _Tast_ in the _Throat_ before described;
and they are all three more or less _Cathartick_. Wherefore, we may
believe, that other _Plants_ which make the like _Impression_ on
the _Throat_, and there are many others which do, that they are in
some degree alike _Cathartick_. Those _Plants_ which are reckoned
amongst the chiefest _Cephalicks_, cause rather a durable, than a
vehement _Heat_ upon the _Tongue_, as _Pyrethrum_, _Euphorbium_,
_Black-Hellebore_, &c. It seemeth therefore reasonable to rank with
these, any other _Plant_, though not used, which produceth the like
durable _Heat_. The young _Roots_ of _Yarrow_, or _Millefolium_, have
the same _Taste_, as the _Root_ of _Contrayerva_: and may therefore be
used for the same purpose, with a probability of the like success; if
not a better, because they may be gotten fresher. But by drying the
_Root_, the _Tast_ and _Virtue_, which lie in its exhalible parts, are
much lost. The _Seeds_ of the lesser _Cardamom_, and of _Zedoary Root_,
if found, have both a smatch of the _Tast_ of _Camphire_. They may
therefore all, so far, reach the same Case.

3. §. Again, as we may make no ill conjecture from the sameness of
_Taste_ in _Plants_ of several _Tribes_; so from the diversity of
_Taste_, in those of the same. So the _Flowers_ of all the _Docks_
are evidently _Astringent_, and not _Sower_; except those of the
_Rha-pontick_, which are extream sower, even in the 5ᵗʰ degree. Which
is no mean _Signature_ of some more than ordinary _Virtue_ in it,
besides what it hath in common with the rest of the _Tribe_. The
_Flowers_ of _Pancy_ have a kind of fulsome _Tast_, plainly different
from that of _Violets_: and in some _Hypochondriacal Cases_ may be more
useful.

4. §. It likewise importeth much, to observe the difference of _Taste_
in the several _Parts_ of the same _Plant_. So the _Barque_ of
_Sassafras_ is three times as strong, as the _Wood_: and the like may
be observed in any other commonly known _Tree_. If therefore we could
obtein the _Barques_ of _Santalum_, _Lignum Rhodium_, _Lignum Aloes_,
&c. they would doubtless, most of them, be of much greater use. And
as the _Taste_ is sometimes stronger; so, much more grateful, in one
_Part_ than in another: as in the _Flowers_ or _Yellow Attire_ in the
_Heads_ of _Carduus Benedictus_; which being infused in _Spirit_ of
_Wine_, or other convenient _Liquor_, make a pleasant _Cordial_. Nature
having laped up the _Virtue_ in the _Leavs_, as in a brown _Paper_; but
in the _Flowers_, as in _Leaf-Gold_.

5. §. As also, how far the _Taste_ of any _Plant_ may alter, either in
preserving, or preparing it. So the _Root_ of _Arum_, when taken fresh
out of the ground, is notably _Pungent_: but being throughly dryed,
and especially kept for some time, hath no more _Taste_, and therefore
in all likelyhood, no more _Virtue_, than a _Lump_ of _Starch_. The
like we are to judge of all other _Plants_, whose _Virtue_ lieth in
their exhalible _Parts_. The _Stillatitious Oyls_ of many _Plants_, are
stronger than the _Leavs_ or other _Parts_ from whence they are drawn:
but some there are, which are weaker; as is that of _Euphorbium_, in
which the _Heat_ is neither pertinaceous, as in the _Gum_ it self, nor
so great.

6. §. We may make, moreover, a judgment from the _Nature_ of the
_Tast_. So those _Roots_ which are _Bitter_, and not _Hot_, as of
_Cichory_, and the rest of the _Intybous_ kind, may be accounted
_Nitro-Sulphureous_; and so, to be _Abstersive_ without any _Heating
Quality_. The _Marum Austriacum_, which is extream _Pungent_, as
well as _Aromatick_, may be looked upon as the best _Cephalick_ of
that _Tribe_. Because we find, that _Jalap_ hath a special property
of imitating the _Glandulous Parts_ of the _Mouth_, and _Throat_; we
may gather, That it is a better _Purge_ to all the other _Glandulous
Parts_, than most other _Catharticks_. Which is also one reason of
its operation, for the most part, with at least a tendency to vomit;
the _Stomach_ it self being _Glandulous_ as well as the _Throat_, and
thereby answerably affected with it. A strong _Infusion_ of _white
Sarzaparilla_ in _Water_, botled up, and kept in a _Cellar_ for the
space of two months, becomes extream sower; far beyond any thing
observed in the _Tasts_ of the _Juyces_ and _Infusions_ of divers
other _Plants_ kept as long and in the same manner. Which shews,
how well Nature hath adapted a _Plant_ of so mild a _Taste_, either
by similitude of parts, for the carrying off of any _preternatural
Acid_; or by contrariety, for the curbing of an exorbitant _Salt_.
The _Barque_ of the _Root_ of common _Wormwood_, which impresseth a
pertinaceous and diffusive _Taste_, which descendeth from the _Tongue_
into the _Gulet_, as is before described; may be justly ranked with
the most excellent _Stomachicks_; and upon tryal, I find it one of the
best: besides, that it is neither unpleasant, nor affecteth the _Head_,
as the _Leavs_. Yet the _Gardener_, and every Body throws it away, as
good for nothing.

7. §. I shall conclude with one note, which is this; That the
_Specifick Virtue_ of _Medicines_, which some _Physicians_ positively
deny, and most dispute; from some of the forementioned _Differences_
of _Taste_, as well as for other reasons, may seem, at least, to be
probable. For why should not a _Medicine_ make an _Impression_ upon one
_Part_, and not upon another, within the _Body_, as well as we find it
doth within the _Mouth_? especially, since the _Parts_ of the _Mouth_,
are of a less different _Nature_, than some of the _Viscera_.




                             _An Appendix._

                       _Of the ODOURS of_ Plants.


THE _Senses_ of _Tasting_ and _Smelling_ being so nearly ally’d; many
things already explained concerning the _Diversities_ and _Causes_
of _Tasts_ in _Plants_, may easily be transferr’d to those of their
_Odours_. I shall now therefore only remarque some particulars, not
commonly taken notice of hitherto, and leave them as a _Specimen_ to be
Improved by other Hands.

2. §. The _Root_ of _Rape-Crowfoot_ being cut, and held to the _Nose_,
when it is newly taken out of the _Ground_, smelleth almost like
_Spirit_ of _Sal Armoniac_, or fresh _Scurvygrass Juyce_. And hath the
property of making the _Eyes_ to water, as _Onions_ do. _Horse-Radish
Root_ is not so _Pungent_ to the _Nose_, but gets pretty much into the
_Eyes_. But that of _Dragon_, doth neither affect the _Eyes_, nor the
_Nose_.

3. §. The _Succulent Roots_ of _Dogstones_, and most of that _Tribe_,
have a rank _Smell_. And that of _Crown Imperial_, being rub’d a
little, smells as like a _Fox_, as one _Fox_ smelleth like another.

4. §. The _Root_ of _Patience_ digested with _Water_, in a warm _Room_,
for the space of three weeks, smels like _Spirit_ of _Harts Horn_, or
other _Urinous Spirit_. Of _Red Dock_, almost like _Aqua fortis_ or
_Spirit_ of _Nitre_. That of _Dragon_ bottled up with _Water_, and set
in a _Cellar_, about a Month, stinks like the _pus_ of the most _Fetid
Ulcer_. At the end of five Months, more abominably, than either to be
endured or expressed.

5. §. The _Leavs_ of _Mountain Calamint_, smell like _Peny Royal_.
Those of _Ulmaria_, like _Walnut Pills_. Of _Yellow Lamium_, like a
_Balsame_. Of _Sena_, a good quantity being held to the _Nose_, of a
rank _Smell_ betwixt that of _Sweat_ and _Urine_. Of _Coriander_, when
green and young, stink so basely, that they can hardly be endur’d.
Sometimes the _Leavs_ have a stronger _Smell_, than the _Flower_, as in
_Borage_, and sometimes the _Stalk_, a stronger than the _Leavs_, as in
_Ulmaria_.

6. §. _Rue Leavs_ corked up in a bottle and set in a _Cellar_ for
about ten weeks, smell like _Spirit_ of _Harts Horn_, or of _Urine_.
The green _Leaves_ of _Roses_ infused in water, have a mild, but
pleasant _Smell_. Neither is that of _Savine_ unpleasant, upon the like
_Infusion_.

7. §. _Scurvygrass Juyce_ kept about ¾ of a year in bottles, with the
green _Sedement_, in a warm _Room_, stinks like Humane _Excrements_.
And _Scurvygrass Wine_, made only of the _Juyce_, smells like some
_Issues_.

8. §. The _Flowers_ of _Yarrow_, smell not much unlike to those of
_Southernwood_. And the _Flowers_ of _Crowfoot_ almost like those of
_Scurvygrass_. Some _Flowers_ are of a weaker _Smell_ in the _Bud_, as
those of _Mallow_. But many have a stronger, than when they are blown
open; as those of _Lavender_, _Rosemary_, &c.

9. §. The _Buds_ of _Vervaine Mallow_, while they are young, and the
_Flowers_ unseen, have a very pleasant _Smell_, like that of _Geranium
Moschatum_: but when afterwards they are opened they have an unpleasant
_Smell_. Common _Mallow Flowers_ dryed and bottled up for some time,
acquire, though not a strong, yet very noysom _Smell_.

10. §. The _Purple Pouch_ of _Dragon_ which covers the _Seed_, being
broken, smells just like a _Lobster_. But permitted to lie in a warm
_Room_ for some days, smells exactly like _Carrion_; and scents the
_Room_ with the same _Smell_.

11. §. Some _Seeds_ as those of _Cumine_, _Daucus_, being powdered and
laped up only in _Papers_, do notwithstanding retein their _Smell_.
But many others, as of _Sweet Fenil_, in a short time, lose it. Some
_Seeds_, when they first begin to sprout, become _Odorous_, which were
not so before; as the _Garden Bean_.

  _In which is shewed, the Compleat or Utmost_ Impregnation _of WATER
     with several kinds of_ Salt, _both together, and apart._


IN discourse upon a _Lecture_ formerly read, concerning the _Lixivial
Salts_ of _Plants_; It was mentioned, as a thing asserted by some
_Phylosophers_, That _Water_ having been fully impregnated with one
kind of _Salt_, so as to bear no more of that kind; it would yet bear,
or dissolve some portion of another; and so of a third. And it was
referred to Me by this Honourable Chair, to examine and produce the
_Experiment_. The doing whereof brought into my mind divers other
_Experiments_ hereunto relating.

2. §. As next, With what difference of quantity this _Superimpregnation_
would be made, upon the _Solution_ of different _Salts_?

3. §. _Thirdly_, Whether the _Solution_ of a smaller quantity of
several _Salts_, doth consist with the _non-increase_ of the bulk of
the _Water_? Because this also is affirmed by some.

4. §. _Fourthly_, What quantity of the several kinds of _Salt_, may be
dissolved severally, in the same quantity of _Water_?

5. §. _Fifthly_, Whether by dissolving a _Salt_ in _Water_, there be
any _Space_ gained, or not? That is, whether the _Bulk_ of the _Water_
be greater, before the _Salt_ lying in it be fully dissolved, than
it is afterwards? Or if a _Cubick Inch_ of _Salt_ be dissolved in
nine _Cubick Inches_ of _Water_; Whether the _Water_ will then fill a
_Vessel_ of ten _Cubick Inches content_?

6. §. _Sixthly_, Whether the _Space_ be equally gained, by an equal
encrease of the same _Salt_?

7. §. _Seventhly_, Whether upon the _Solution_ of several kinds of
_Salts_, be gained so many several quantities of _Space_? That is, if
the _Solution_ of common _Salt_ gains, suppose, an _Inch_, whether the
_Solution_ of _Salt Armoniack_ gains as much, or more, or less? and so
for other _Salts_.

8. §. _Eighthly_, What that just space may be, which any _Salt_ gaineth
with respect to its own _Bulk_, or that of the _Water_?

9. §. And first, for the _Superimpregnation_ of _Water_; I put into
a bottle ℥ij of fair _Water_; adding thereto, first half an Ounce of
_Nitre_; and afterwards more, as the _Water_ would dissolve it; and
(that I might be sure the _Impregnation_ was full) some portion above
what the _Water_ would bear. Then having separated this remaining
portion; I put to this _Solution_ of _Nitre_, two Drachms of _Sal
Armoniac_; which wholly and easily dissolved in the said _Solution_;
though it would not bear a grain more of _Nitre_. I then added a third
Drachm of _Sal Armoniac_, after that a fourth, and a fifth; all which,
within the space of half an hour, were perfectly dissolved in the said
_Solution_, without any precipitation of the _Nitre_.

10. §. In the making of this Experiment, two things, to render it
infallacious, are to be noted. That the said _Salts_ were not dissolved
by the help of _Fire_, but only by a strong and continued _Agitation_.
And that this was done upon a warm day: which I mention, because that
even the changes of the weather will somewhat alter the _Solubility_ of
the _Salts_.

11. §. Having made the Experiment upon two _Salts_, I proceeded to
repeat it upon three. And first I dissolved as much common _Salt_ in
℥ij of _Water_, as that quantity would bear. Then having separated the
subsiding portion; I put to the _Solution_, no less than five Drachms
of _Nitre_, which by a continued _Agitation_, was wholly dissolved
therein, neither the _Nitre_ nor the common _Salt_ being in the least
precipitated. Then adding a Scruple more, it would not dissolve, but
subsided. This second subsiding portion, I again separated; and then
put to this _Superimpregnation_, near ʒj of _Sal Armoniac_, which
was also dissolved as the former. And if as many more _Salts_ had
been added, ’tis probable that the same _Water_ would have born some
quantity of them all.

12. §. From this Experiment, it is a Conclusion demonstrated, That not
only the visible _Crystals_, but the very _Atomes_ of every _Salt_, at
least those _Particles_ which are ultimately dissolved in _Water_, have
a different _Figure_ one from another. Because that if they were all of
one _Figure_; there would be no _Superimpregnation_, but the _Pores_
of the same _Water_, would imbibe as much of one _Salt_, as answers
to the total of two more _Salts_ imbibed: that is to say, it would as
well imbibe two Ounces of common _Salt_, as one Ounce of common _Salt_
and another of _Nitre_: which yet is contrary to the Experiment. And
it is the same thing, whether we suppose the _Pores_ of _Water_ to be
also different, or not. Because, that if the _Figure_ of all the said
_Atomes_ be the same; then their respect to the _Pores_ of the _Water_
must be the same, how different so ever those _Pores_ be: which is also
contrary to the Experiment. Besides it is a great presumption, to say,
that the _Pores_, and therefore the _Atomes_ of _Water_ have different
_Figures_; and yet not those of _Salts_.

13. §. From the same Experiment we may go upon good ground in
_Compounded Infusions_; whether of _Purgative_, or other _Materials_.
As not doubting, but that the same _Menstruum_ may be highly
impregnated with several _Ingredients_ at once, whose operative
parts may be therein copiously dissolved, without hindring either an
_Extraction_, or causing a _Precipitation_ one of an other.

14. §. The _Second_ Enquiry is, With what difference this
_Superimpregnation_ of _Water_ is made? which I find considerable. For
a _Solution_ of above five Drachms of _Nitre_ may be _superimpregnated_
with no less quantity of _Sal Armoniac_. And a _Solution_ of five
Drachms of common _Salt_, may be _superimpregnated_ with as much
_Nitre_. Yet neither a strong _Solution_ (as of five Drachms) of common
_Salt_, will bear above two Scruples of _Sal Armoniac_: nor will a
strong _Solution_ (as of five Drachms) of _Sal Armoniac_, bear above
a Drachm of common _Salt_: for if above the said quantities of either
of them be mixed together: they are both copiously and forthwith
precipitated to the bottome of the _Glass_.

15. §. Whence, notwithstanding the former Experiment, yet are
we admonished, not to infuse all manner of _Ingredients_ in any
proportion. Because though some do not, yet others will precipitate one
another.

16. §. The _Third_ Enquiry was this, Whether the _Solution_ of
a smaller quantity of several _Salts_, doth consist with the
_non-increase_ of the _Bulk_ of the _Water_? For this I took a
_Bolthead_ with a slender _Neck_, conteining about a pint and a quarter
of _Water_; and dissolved therein about ℥jß of _Nitre_. And marking the
place to which the _Water_ ascended in the _Neck_ of the _Bolthead_:
I then dissolved in the same _Water_ about a Drachm of _Sal Gemmæ_:
which little quantity, raised the _Water_ above half an Inch higher
then it was before. The like I observed in the addition of _Nitre_ to a
_Solution_ of _Sal Armoniac_. So that to suppose the variation of the
_Salt_ doth prevent the increase of the _Bulk_ of the _Water_, is a
manifest Error.

17. §. From the same Experiment it also appears, That the ascent of the
_Water_ upon a _Superimpregnation_, is the same, by whatsoever _Salt_
the first _Impregnation_ be made. For instance, Let a _Solution_ of
_Nitre_ ascend in the _Neck_ of the _Bolthead_, suppose, to 10 Inches,
then add ½ an Ounce more of _Nitre_, so as to raise the _Water_,
suppose, 12 Inches or more, or less, according to the _Bore_ of the
_Neck_. In like manner, let a _Solution_ of _Sal Armoniac_ reach to ten
Inches: then add again half an Ounce of _Nitre_; and it will reach just
12 Inches, or more or less, as before.

18. §. The _Fourth_ Enquiry is, What quantity of the several kinds of
_Salt_, may be dissolved severally in the same quantity of _Water_:
that is to say, by agitation alone, without the help of fire, as I
noted before. And upon tryal it appears, First, that two Ounces of
_Water_ will dissolve three Ounces of _Loaf-Sugar_ and no more, except
the _Water_ be heated.

19. §. The same quantity of _Water_ that is, two Ounces will dissolve
above two Ounces of _Salt_ of _Tartar_. I say above, for how much more,
want of a greater quantity of _Salt_ which I could confide in, made me
that I could not finish the Experiment.

20. §. The same quantity, _sc._ two Ounces of _Water_, dissolveth an
Ounce and a Drachm of _Green Vitriol_.

21. §. The like quantity dissolveth six Drachms and a Scruple or above
¾ of an Ounce of common _Salt_.

22. §. Of _Nitre_, Five Drachms two Scruples and an half.

23. §. Of _Sal Armoniac_, five Drachms and two Scruples.

24. §. Of _Alum_, not above two Drachms and a Scruple.

25. §. And of _Borax_, not above a Drachm and half a Scruple.

26. §. Of these note, That although Common _Salt_ be very dissoluble,
and will presently catch the moysture of the _Aer_: yet a much greater
quantity not only of _Salt_ of _Tartar_, but even of _Loaf Sugar_, and
of _Green Vitriol_ it self, may be dissolved in _Water_ than of Common
_Salt_.

27. §. Again, as the great _Solubility_ of some, so the less
_Solubility_ of other _Salts_ is also observable, as of _Alum_, and
_Borax_. For the same quantity of _Water_ will dissolve near four times
as much of _Green Vitriol_, as it will of _Alum_. And of _Sugar_ more
than ten times as much. Of _Green Vitriol_ near eight times as much as
of _Borax_; and of _Sugar_, twenty times as much.

28. §. From this Experiment we are likewise cautioned, not only in the
_Infusion_ of several _Ingredients_ together, but of any one singly;
that such a proportion thereof to the _Menstruum_, be not exceeded. For
all that is over and above what the _Menstruum_ will bear, is either
not extracted, or will be precipitated. As is evident not only in the
_Dissolution_ of the _Salts_ above named, but in the _Infusion_ of
_Plants_ themselves: as, for instance, of _Senna_; two Drachms whereof
will impregnate four Ounces of _Water_ as strongly, as if twice the
quantity were infused; because the _Water_ will bear no more of the
_Purgative Parts_ of that _Body_.

29. §. There is only one _Salt_ more remaineth to be spoken of under
this Experiment; and that is, the _Crystals_ of _Tartar_. Whereof, it
is somewhat strange to observe, that it will scarce at all dissolve
in _Water_: not more, than even divers _Resinous Gums_, as _Mastick_,
_Tolu_, _Tacchamahacca_, and some others will do. For if two Drachms,
suppose of these _Crystals_, of _Tartar_ (commonly sold for _Cremor
Tartari_) be put to one Ounce of _Water_, scarce five Grains thereof
will, by _Agitation_, be therein dissolved.




                                CHAP. II.

  _In which is shewed, that by the_ Solution _of_ Salts _in_ Water,
     _some certain space, more or less, is gained. That the space is
     different according to the Nature of the_ Salt. _And what the
     just space is, which is gained._


THE _Fifth_ Enquiry is, Whether by dissolving of a _Salt_ in _Water_,
there be any space gained, or not. That is, whether the _Bulk_ of the
_Water_ be greater before the _Salt_ lying in it be fully dissolved,
than afterwards. For tryal whereof, I took a _Bolt-head_ with a slender
_Neck_, holding somewhat more than a pint; and filling it up to a
certain place in the _Neck_; I then put in an Ounce or two of _Salt_.
And observing the hight of the _Water_, both before it was dissolved,
and afterwards; It plainly appeared, that there was some, and that a
considerable space, gained by the _Dissolution_; the _Water_ thereby
sinking several Inches below the place, where it stood after the _Salt_
was first put into it.

2. §. From this Experiment it is plain, that there are _Vacuities_
in _Water_. That is to say, that all the parts of _Water_ are not
contiguous, but that either betwixt, or in the _Atomes_ of the _Water_
themselves, there are certain _Pores_, either absolutely void, or at
least filled up with another more subtile body which is easily excluded
by the particles of _Salt_: by possessing the room of which the above
said space is gained.

3. §. The _Sixth_ Enquiry is, Whether the space be equally gained, by
an equal encrease of the same _Salt_.

4. §. For this I made two tryals; the first was this. Two half Ounces
of _Salt Armoniac_, being successively dissolved in the same _Water_;
both of them raised up the _Water_ in the _Neck_ of the _Bolt-head_,
equally; the first 3 Inches ⅝, and so the second.

5. §. The other was this. Four half Ounces of _Nitre_, being
successively dissolved in the same _Water_, they all of them raised
up the _Water_ in the _Neck_ of the _Bolt-head_, equally; the first a
little above two Inches, and the 2ᵈ, 3ᵈ, and 4ᵗʰ, just as much.

6. §. The _Seventh_ Enquiry is, Whether upon the _Dissolution_ of
several kinds of _Salts_, be gained so many several quantities of
space. For this I made tryal upon Eleven several _Salts_, sc. _Salt_
of _Tartar_, _Common Salt_, _Sal Gemmeus_, _Roman Vitriol_, _Nitre_,
_White Vitriol_, _Green Vitriol_, _Alum_, _Borax_, _Loaf-Sugar_, and
_Sal Armoniac_; of all which, I dissolved an equal quantity _sc._ two
Ounces, in an equal quantity of _Water_, severally; that is, taking
fresh _Water_ for every _Solution_. The success was, That the _Sal
Armoniac_ raised the _Water_ 15 Inches. The _Loaf-Sugar_, 13 Inches
and ⅜ᵗʰˢ· The _Borax_, a Foot. The _Alum_ 11 Inches, and ⅝ᵗʰˢ. _Green
Vitriol_, 9 Inches and ⅝ᵗʰˢ· _White Vitriol_, 9 Inches and ⅛ᵗʰ.
_Nitre_, 8 Inches, and ⅜ᵗʰˢ· _Roman Vitriol_, 7 Inches and ⅝ᵗʰˢ· _Sal
Gemmæ_, 6 Inches, and ⅝ᵗʰˢ· _Common Salt_, 6 Inches and ⅜ᵗʰˢ· _Salt_ of
_Tartar_, not above 4 Inches and ⅛ᵗʰ. All which differences are plain,
and most of them very remarquable: Two Ounces of _Sal Armoniac_ raising
the _Water_ near four times as high, as the same quantity of _Salt_ of
_Tartar_.

7. §. From this and the fourth Experiment, compared, it also appears,
That the several spaces gained by the several _Salts_, though
sometimes they do, yet do not always answer to the _Solubility_ of
the said _Salts_. As to give some Instances; _Loaf-Sugar_ is the most
dissoluble of any other _Salt_; yet it gaineth less space than all the
rest, save only _Sal Armoniac_. So _Green Vitriol_ is more dissoluble
then either _Nitre_ or _Common Salt_; yet gaineth less space than
either, especially than the latter. And _Sal Armoniac_, which is more
dissoluble than _Alum_ or _Borax_, yet gaineth less space than either
of them. The _Cause_ whereof is not easily assigned.

8. §. Note also, that by the same Experiment, as well as by the _Taste_
and other Circumstances, it is plain, That _Sal Gemmæ_ is nothing else
but _Common Salt_, coagulated or _Crystalliz’d_ under _Ground_.

9. §. Again, as the Fifth Experiment sheweth, That there are
_Vacuities_ in _Water_: so doth this Last, that those _Vacuities_,
are of differing kinds. Because, otherwise, it should seem, That the
_Bulk_ of the _Water_ would increase, more or less, according to the
_Solubilitie_ of every _Salt_, and not be alternately differenced as it
is; Some _Salts_, more dissoluble, increasing the _Bulk_ of the _Water_
less, and others less dissoluble, increasing it more. I say, that this
difference dependeth not only upon the different _Figures_ of the
_Atomes_ of _Salt_; because then every _Salt_ which is more dissoluble,
would (quantity for quantity) take up less room in the _Water_: which
is contrary to the Experiment.

10. §. From the same Experiment, howsoever _paradoxical_ it may seem,
yet is it also manifest, That although _Water_ be a _Fluid_, yet the
_Particles_ thereof are _hard_ and _consistent_, and unalterable in
their _Figure_. Otherwise it is plain, That all manner of _Salts_ would
be dissolved in the same manner, and take up the same room in the
_Water_. For let the _Figures_ of the _Salts_ be never so various, yet
if the _Particles_ of _Water_ were themselves _Fluid_ or _Inconsistent_
and _Alterable_, they would always so conforme to those _Figures_,
as to fill up all _Vacuities_; and so upon the _Solution_ of several
_Salts_, if of equal quantity, the _Water_ would still retein an
equal _Bulk_. As suppose an Ounce of _Iron_ were drawn into _Wyer_,
another beaten into _Plates_, a third made into _Hooks_, a fourth into
_Needles_, a fifth into _Nails_; every one of these five Ounces, being
put severally into _Water_ will encrease its _Bulk_ equally. I conclude
therefore, That the _Atomes_ of _Water_ are hard and unalterable.

11. §. The _Eighth_ Enquiry was this, What that just space might be,
which any _Salt_ gaineth upon _Dissolution_, with respect to its
own _Bulk_, or the _Bulk_ of the _Water_? For the making of this
Experiment, _Water_ will not serve, nor yet _Spirit_ of _Wine_; because
they both of them dissolve more or less of those _Salts_ which are put
into them; whereby the observation of the true _Bulk_ of the _Salt_,
and consequently of the just space it gaineth by _Dissolution_ is
lost. I took therefore _Oyl_ of _Turpentine_, and pouring it into
a _Bolt-head_, marked the place of its ascent in the _Neck_. Then
pouring likewise into it two Ounces of _Common Salt_, I marked the
second ascent of the _Oyl_; and found it to be 10 Inches and 6 eighths.
Repeating the Experiment in like manner with two Ounces of _Nitre_, I
found the ascent of the _Oyl_ to be 11 Inches and ⅛ᵗʰ. Repeating it
again with two Ounces of _Alum_, the ascent of the _Oyl_ was 13 Inches
and 2/8ᵗʰˢ· And making it once more with _Sal Armoniac_, the _Oyl_
ascended to 15 Inches: the said several ascents of the _Oyl_ being
the true spaces which the Four abovesaid _Salts_ take. From which,
the space which the same _Salts_ take up upon _Dissolution_, being
deducted; the remainder is the space gained by that _Dissolution_. And
so it appears, first, that _Sal Armoniac_ gaineth nothing; being the
only _Salt_ of all I have tryed, which causeth the equal ascent both of
the _Water_ and the _Oyl_ _sc._ just 15 Inches in both. _Alum_ causeth
the ascent of the _Oyl_ to 13-2/8ᵗʰˢ, of the _Water_, to 11 Inches and
⅝ᵗʰˢ: So that it gains about 1 Inch and ½ out of 13. _Nitre_ causeth
the ascent of the _Oyl_, to 11 Inches and ⅛ᵗʰ; of the _Water_, to 8
Inches and ⅜ᵗʰˢ· So that _Nitre_ by _Dissolution_ gets almost the space
of 3 Inches in 11. _Common Salt_ causeth the ascent of the _Oyl_, to 10
Inches and 6/8ᵗʰˢ; of the _Water_, 6 Inches and ⅜ᵗʰˢ· So that _Common
Salt_ gains by _Dissolution_ 4 Inches in 10, which is very considerable.

12. §. By this way the _Specifick Gravity_ of all kinds of _Salts_
may be easily taken, and the difference betwixt them is somewhat
surprizing. For it appears by the Ascent of the _Oyl_, that _Nitre_,
quantity for quantity, is about a 22ᵗʰ part lighter than _Common Salt_.
_Alum_ about a 6ᵗʰ part lighter. And _Salt Armoniac_, almost a 4ᵗʰ
part lighter than _Common Salt_. The like estimate may be made of the
_Gravity_ of all other _Salts_.

13. §. By the same Experiment it also appears, That according to the
_Specifick Gravity_ of _Salts_ they are many times at least more or
less _Volatile_; as in the four last _Salts_ is plain. For _Common
Salt_ which of all the four is the most fixed, is also the heavyest.
_Nitre_ which is somewhat less fixed is somewhat lighter. But _Alum_
which is still less fixed is much lighter. And _Sal Armoniac_ which is
wholly _Volatile_, is the lightest of all the _Salts_ above mentioned.




                               CHAP. III.

  _Wherein, from the Experiments in the foregoing_ Chapter, _is
     shewed, the_ Cause _of the_ Motion _of the Mercury in the
     BAROMETER._


FOR the doing of this, it will first be acknowledg’d, That not
only several sorts of _Sulphur_, but also of _Volatile Salts_, are
continually sublimed from most _Bodies_ into the _Aer_. So _Lightning_,
from the celerity of the ascension, appears to be made of a _Meteor_,
which is _Nitro-Sulphureous_. _Snow_ dependeth upon a _Mixture_ of
_Nitrous_, and other _Salts_; as is evident, from the regularly and
differently _Figur’d Parts_, which compose the whole Body of a _Snowy
Cloud_, before it clusters into _Flakes_. And one reason, why _Rain_
is the best _Water_ for any _Soyl_, is because it is impregnated with
divers _Volatile_ and _Fruitful Salts_. And so from other _Meteors_.

2. §. And next, that these _Salts_, are not always in the same
_Quantity_, _Proportion_, and _State_, in the _Aer_: but that sometimes
they are more copious; at others, less: sometimes, one more copious,
than an other: sometimes, more plentifully dissolved; at others,
more sparingly: and that, either as they are more or less pure and
dissoluble; or according to the quantity of the _Vaporous Parts_ in the
_Aer_, in which they are incorporated or dissolved.

3. §. Thus much being granted, from the _Experiments_ in the foregoing
_Chapter_ compared together, we may resolve our selves about some
_Phænomena_ in the _Barometre_. Which seems to vary, not so much with
the meer _Weight_ of the _Aer_, which hitherto hath been supposed:
as by the different pressure it makes, in being _crowded_ more at
one time, than at another. That is, according as certain _Nitrous_,
or other _Saline Bodies_, take up less _Space_ in the _Aer_, when
dissolved in the _Watery Parts_ therein, than while they are
undissolved.

4. §. And therefore it is especially to be observed, That as the
_Mercury_ commonly riseth in the _Cylinder_ for some days, but always
for some time, before the change of the _Weather_, whether for _Snow_
or _Rain_: So, that then it presently falleth again, even before the
_Snow_ or _Rain_ falls. Whereas, if the _Weight_ of the _Aer_, were
the only, or the chief _Cause_ of the ascent of the _Mercury_; than as
it riseth all the while the _Weather_ is gathering, so it would keep
its standing or heighth, until the _Weather_ breaks and falleth down:
which yet it never doth, but always falls before it; sometimes no
less than a whole day. The _Cause_ whereof is, in that all the while
the _Mercury_ riseth in the _Cylinder_, the _Aer_ is _crowded_ with
more and more _Saline Parts_, which by the _Winds_, or otherwise,
are carryed into it; and so causeth it to press upon the _Mercury_
in the _Box_: but after that in some time the _Salts_ are dissolved
or incorporated in the _Aqueous Parts_ of the _Aer_, as in _Rain_ or
_Snow_; so soon as that is done, there is some _Space_ gaind; and so,
before any _Weather_ falleth, the _Aer_ is less crowded, and presseth
less upon the _Mercury_ in the _Box_, which gives way to its descent in
the _Cylinder_.

5. §. From hence also it is, that the _Mercury_ riseth higher with
_Cold Winds_, than it doth with those which are _Warme_. Both because
that in _cold Winds_ there is the greatest quantity of _Nitre_: and
that the _coldest Winds_, are usually the dryest. So that the _Nitre_
wanting _Moysture_ fully to dissolve it; it takes up so much the
greater space, and so causeth a greater pressure in the _Aer_, as hath
been said.

6. §. _Lastly_, For the same reason it comes to pass, that the
_Mercury_ first riseth higher, and then falleth lower before _Snow_,
than it doth before _Rain_. Because that for the production of _Snow_,
the _Aer_ is crowded with a greater quantity of _Nitre_, or some other
like _Salts_; which before they are dissolved, take up so much the more
space; and afterwards so much the less, even before the _Snow_ falls:
as hath been proved.

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ANATOMY OF PLANTS ***


    

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.


START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
